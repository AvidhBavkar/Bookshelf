This research aims to design and analyze a single-stage supersonic turbine with a rated power of approximately 440~KW. We present a comprehensive preliminary design roadmap followed by design parameters optimization. The preliminary sizing is carried out using one-dimensional flow analysis, while the blade geometrical design is performed using the two-dimensional method of characteristics. The turbine performance is then analyzed through numerical simulations on three-dimensional models. Comprehensive parametric analyses are conducted to examine the turbine performance sensitivity to changes in partial admission (PA), mean radius, and turbine blade height using three-dimensional sliding mesh techniques (SMT). The current analysis simulates the full turbine to capture PA effects, rather than focusing on a single periodic sector as is common in turbomachinery simulation practices. Different PA scenarios are investigated, emphasizing a single rotor passage over a complete rotor cycle in a partially admitted turbine, and examining its charging and discharging mechanisms. Flow tracking over such a blade shows that the turbine rotor exhibits compressor-like behavior over most of the unadmitted zone, contributing to efficiency drops and severe transients.},

  abstract = {A cavitating venturi is a flow control device usually used to deliver constant mass flow rate when operated at cavitation conditions. Experiments were conducted on a small type venturi test rig under varying upstream, throat and downstream conditions. A model for water vapor void fraction is proposed and validated against detailed image analysis of the cavitating process. Both experimental and model results showed that cavitation occurs at a certain critical pressure ratio (downstream pressure/upstream pressure) where the liquid starts to evaporate at the throat of the venturi. As the venturi pressure ratio is decreased than the critical pressure ratio, the mass flow rate is choked resulting in an increased vapor formation in the divergent part of the venturi. This can be predicted by the proposed model as well as the image analysis. Through all the conducted venturi experiments, the critical pressure ratio ranges from 0.70–0.72 corresponding to an upstream temperature of 21°C. At a temperature of 42°C the critical pressure ratio was increased to 0.75. Image analysis clearly shows the vapor formation from the throat up to the middle of the divergent part of the venturi. Traces of vapor are observed at the exit of the venturi where the thermodynamic conditions cannot maintain the existence of vapor bubbles.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to quantify the impact of rotor–stator interaction on surface heat transfer of film cooled turbine blades. In Section I, a steady-state injection model of the film cooling is incorporated into a two-dimensional, thin shear layer, multiblade row CFD code. This injection model accounts for the penetration and spreading of the coolant jet, as well as the entrainment of the boundary layer fluid by the coolant. The code is validated, in the steady state, by comparing its predictions to data from a blade tested in linear cascade. In Section II, time-resolved film cooled turbine rotor heat transfer measurements are compared with numerical predictions. Data were taken on a fully film cooled blade in a transonic, high pressure ratio, single-stage turbine in a short duration turbine test facility, which simulates full-engine nondimensional conditions. Film cooled heat flux on the pressure surface is predicted to be as much as a factor of two higher in the time average of the unsteady calculations compared to the steady-state case. Time-resolved film cooled heat transfer comparison of data to prediction at two spanwise positions is used to validate the numerical code. The unsteady stator–rotor interaction results in the pulsation of the coolant injection flow out of the film holes with large-scale fluctuations. The combination of pulsating coolant flow and the interaction of the coolant with this unsteady external flow is shown to lower the local pressure side adiabatic film effectiveness by as much as 64 percent when compared to the steady-state case.},

The flight performance is simulated using a seventh- to eight-order Runge–Kutta integrator for the six-degree-of-freedom dynamics. The optimizer used for design iterations is a binary-encoded genetic algorithm with a proven track record for addressing complex flight vehicle design problems.

We analyze different eDOC strategies, focusing on pH swing as the primary mechanism for ocean dissolved inorganic carbon removal, and examine techno-economic challenges, such as achieving industrially preferred current densities and reducing overall costs. Early designs have relied on bipolar membrane electrodialysis, while recent developments have eliminated the need for membranes entirely. We compare different approaches, highlighting the limitations of current eDOC systems. Our study provides insights into the optimization of eDOC systems, suggesting further research is needed to improve system efficiency and address design bottlenecks for large-scale deployment.

  abstract = {This work analyzes the interaction between non-equilibrium plasma and detonation. The aim is to enhance the detonability of gaseous mixtures by reducing the detonation cell width through dissociation of a fresh gas mixture by plasma action. The experiments were performed in a square-section detonation tube, and the diagnostic tools used were ICCD chemiluminescence imaging, soot-plate recording, dynamic pressure sensors, and back current shunt technique. The results show that the application of a nanosecond plasma ahead of a self-sustained detonation reduces the cell width by a factor of about 2 in H2:O2:Ar, H2:O2, CH4:H2:O2:Ar and CH4:O2:Ar mixtures for initial pressures between 100 and 200 mbar. A parametric study of plasma properties focused on the effect of the initial pressure on the deposited energy and homogeneity. A kinetic mechanism was proposed to estimate the dissociation effect of plasma chemistry on the fresh combustible mixture. The obtained densities of atoms produced in the plasma were used as input parameters to calculate the thermicity and temperature profiles of the detonation reaction zone according to the Zel’dovich–von Neumann–Döring model. The reduction factor of the ZND characteristic chemical length is about the same as the experimental cell widths, i.e. 2. This combination of experiments and calculations substantiates the relationship between plasma parameters, ZND chemical lengths, and detonation cell widths and, thus, demonstrates the possibility of controlling detonability using a nanosecond discharge. Novelty and significance The novelty is the first experimental demonstration that the action of a non-equilibrium plasma on a fresh combustible mixture can instantaneously produce enough atomic species ahead of a self-sustained detonation front to reduce by about half the mean width of the cells that structure the detonation reaction zone in gases. The significance is that a nanosecond discharge is now proven to be a means of controlling detonability, here considered as the ability of a detonation to propagate in a device of given transverse dimensions, since the smaller the cells, the higher the detonability.},

Each row of the matrix representing the temperature distribution is fitted with a specific function, and its respective error is calculated. In this way, the projected matrix can be represented with the fitted functions. As a result of the procedure used in this research, a slice of the flame is obtained by assuming a cylindrical symmetry of it and multiplying the fitted function by itself.

  abstract = {In this study we present detailed aerodynamic and thermal field measurements downstream of an annular cascade of fully-cooled nozzle guide vanes (NGVs). The experiments were conducted in the Engine Component AeroThermal (ECAT) facility at the University of Oxford, at engine-matched conditions of Reynolds number and Mach number, and high turbulence intensity. The experimental data are unusually high-fidelity and allow for detailed comparison with modern computational fluids dynamics (CFD) methods. We compare the experimental data to simulations of fully-featured geometry (resolved internal geometry and film cooling holes). We analyze distributions of whirl angle, kinetic energy loss, and non-dimensional temperature at three axial planes downstream of the NGVs. The aerodynamic and thermal wakes are also characterized in terms of their spreading and decay rates. The analysis is deepened with detailed comparison to a previous data-set for a different design of heavily-cooled NGV. The analysis a useful reference point for assessing the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art numerical methods used in the engine design process.},

However, current micro-endoscopes cannot perform three-dimensional imaging through dynamically-bent fibers without the use of bulky optical elements such as lenses and scanners at the distal end, increasing the footprint and tissue-damage. Great efforts have been invested in developing approaches that avoid distal bulky optical elements. However, the fundamental barrier of dynamic optical wavefront-distortions in propagation through flexible fibers limits current approaches to nearly-static or non-flexible fibers. Here, we present an approach that allows holographic, bend-insensitive, coherence-gated, micro-endoscopic imaging using commercially available multi-core fibers (MCFs). We achieve this by adding a partially-reflecting mirror to the distal fiber-tip, allowing to perform low-coherence full-field phase-shifting holography. We demonstrate widefield diffraction-limited reflection imaging of amplitude and phase targets through dynamically bent fibers at video-rate. Our approach holds potential for label-free investigations of dynamic samples.},

  abstract = {As traditional scientific disciplines individually grow towards their maturity, many new opportunities for significant advances lie at their intersection. For example, remarkable developments in control theory in the last few decades have considerably expanded the selection of available tools which may be applied to regulate physical and electrical systems. These techniques hold great promise for several applications in fluid mechanics, including the delay of transition and the regulation of turbulence. Such applications of control theory require a very balanced perspective, in which one considers the relevant flow physics when designing the control algorithms and, conversely, takes into account the requirements and limitations of control algorithms when designing both reduced-order flow models and the fluid–mechanical systems to be controlled themselves. Such a balanced perspective is elusive, however, as both the research establishment in general and universities in particular are accustomed only to the dissemination and teaching of component technologies in isolated fields. To advance, we must not toss substantial new interdisciplinary questions over the fence for fear of them being “outside our area”; rather, we must break down these very fences that limit us, and attack these challenging new questions with a Renaissance approach. In this spirit, this paper surveys a few recent attempts at bridging the gaps between the several scientific disciplines comprising the field of flow control, in an attempt to clarify the author's perspective on how recent advances in these constituent disciplines fit together in a manner that opens up significant new research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Aiming at radical increase of gas turbine thermal efficiency, novel pressure gain combustion (PGC) processes are being investigated. These inherently unsteady techniques include pulse/rotating detonation, shockless explosion and wave rotor combustion. They all introduce periodic disturbances on the flow dynamics, which strongly challenge performance and aeroelastic design. The current work appraises to which degree this additional unsteadiness affects an industrial highpressure compressor (HPC). Single and multirow unsteady computational fluid dynamics and aeroelastic analyses characterize how the induced disturbances travel through the system, driving a departure from the steady state design. Assessments with one to four rows (two stages) delineate how farther upstream the disturbance dynamics must be considered by the performance and aeroelastic designers. To that end, unsteady damping as well as maximum stresses are evaluated. The nonlinear harmonic balance method is employed to determine the aerodynamic work and corresponding damping. Modal forcing from unsteady time-resolved runs is then projected into the blade surface. The structural response is obtained through harmonic response analyses, in a decoupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) fashion.},

Data were taken at Rec=20K with 3\% inlet freestream turbulence and a wake-passing flow coefficient of 0.8. Without unsteady wakes, a nonreattaching separation bubble exists on the suction surface of the blade beginning at 68\% axial chord. The time-averaged separation zone is reduced in size by approximately 35\% in the presence of unsteady wakes. Phase-locked hot-wire and PIV measurements were used to document the dynamics of this separation zone when subjected to synchronized, unsteady forcing from a spanwise row of vortex generator jets (VGJs) in addition to the unsteady wakes. The phase difference between VGJ actuation and the wake passing was optimized.

  abstract = {A multistage optimization method is developed yielding Tesla valves that are efficient even at low flow rates, characteristic, e.g., for almost all microfluidic systems, where passive valves have intrinsic advantages over active ones. We report on optimized structures that show a diodicity of up to 1.8 already at flow rates of 20\,μl\,s−1 corresponding to a Reynolds number of 36. Centerpiece of the design is a topological optimization based on the finite element method. It is set-up to yield easy-to-fabricate valve structures with a small footprint that can be directly used in microfluidic systems. Our numerical two-dimensional optimization takes into account the finite height of the channel approximately by means of a so-called shallow-channel approximation. Based on the three-dimensionally extruded optimized designs, various test structures were fabricated using standard, widely available microsystem manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process is described in detail since it can be used for the production of similar cost-effective microfluidic systems. For the experimentally fabricated chips, the efficiency of the different valve designs, i.e., the diodicity defined as the ratio of the measured pressure drops in backward and forward flow directions, respectively, is measured and compared to theoretical predictions obtained from full 3D calculations of the Tesla valves. Good agreement is found. In addition to the direct measurement of the diodicities, the flow profiles in the fabricated test structures are determined using a two-dimensional microscopic particle image velocimetry (μPIV) method. Again, a reasonable good agreement of the measured flow profiles with simulated predictions is observed.},

  abstract = {Geometrical camera modeling is the precondition for 3D-reconstruction tasks using photogrammetric sensor systems. The purpose of this study is to describe an approach for possible accuracy improvements by using the ray-based-camera model. The relations between the common pinhole and the generally valid ray-based-camera model are shown. A new approach to the implementation and calibration of the ray-based-camera model is introduced. Using a simple laboratory setup consisting of two cameras and a projector, experimental measurements were performed. The experiments and results showed the possibility of easily transforming the common pinhole model into a ray-based model and of performing calibration using the ray-based model. These initial results show the model’s potential for considerable accuracy improvements, especially for sensor systems using wide-angle lenses or with deep 3D measurements. This study presents several approaches for further improvements to and the practical usage of high-precision optical 3D measurements.},

  abstract = {Supersonic inlet flow is usually considered to be detrimental to the performance of turbine systems. A new class of bladeless turbines was developed, which allows for power extraction from supersonic axial inflows without swirl with minimal maintenance cost. This is achieved through a wavy hub surface that promotes shocks and expansion fans and hence generates torque. In a first step, a baseline bladeless turbine is designed and the power extraction is analyzed. The bladeless turbine surface is parametrized in matlab and subsequently imported into Hexpress (Numeca) to mesh an unstructured grid. The first layer thickness is kept below one for all the simulations. The unstructured mesh is loaded into cfd++ (Metacomp) to solve the three dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. Second, the work extraction principle is broken down from a three-dimensional unsteady problem into a two-dimensional steady phenomenon. An experimental campaign is outlined and test details are discussed. Finally, after the experimental characterization, the operational envelope and scaling of the bladeless turbine are described for several reduced mass flows, reduced speeds, and geometrical features of the turbine (amplitude of the wavy surface, helix angle, hub radius, and length of the axial turbine).},

The energy transfer is achieved through a wavy hub surface that promotes shocks and expansion fans. First, a design procedure and the non-dimensional steady-state performance characteristics (the reduced torque, non-dimensional mass flow, and non-dimensional speed) are presented (including an exergetic analysis) at on– and off-design conditions through time-averaged Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. A cycle analysis was performed on a Mach 3 vehicle to demonstrate the feasibility of this technology. Second, energy extraction is achieved from the highly unsteady exhaust of rotating detonation combustors without needing an additional intermediate diffuser or nozzle. The rotating boundary conditions were computed from a reactive unsteady simulation. The influence of three shock parameters (pressure ratio across the shock, shock wave Mach number, and the number of waves) is investigated through a sensitivity study to assess the robustness of the new device. Furthermore, depending on the sense of rotation of the bladeless turbine relative to the rotation of the incoming shock and the helix angle, we can define two different modes of operation in which power extraction was achieved, namely, the shock mode and reversed mode.},

We review modeling, simulation, and multidisciplinary optimization capabilities, and identify current shortcomings. We conclude that the electric aircraft design problem introduces new coupling between previously distinct disciplines, such as aerodynamics and propulsion, which may only become apparent with high-fidelity, physics-based analysis.

For subsonic flow and reduced frequencies as large as 0.9, airfoil surface unsteady pressures resulting from oscillation of one of the airfoils are measured using flush-mounted high-frequency-response pressure transducers. The influence coefficient data are examined in detail and then used to predict the unsteady aerodynamics of a cascade oscillating at various interblade phase angles. These results are correlated with experimental data obtained in the traveling-wave mode of oscillation and linearized analysis predictions. It is found that the unsteady pressure disturbances created by an oscillating airfoil excite wind tunnel acoustic modes which have detrimental effects on the experimental data. Acoustic treatment is proposed to rectify this problem.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of nozzle guide vane (NGV) capacity is essential for understanding engine performance data, and to achieve accurate turbine stage matching. In accelerated engine development programmes in particular, accurate and early assessment of NGV capacity is a significant advantage. Whilst the capabilities of computational methods have improved rapidly in recent years, the accuracy of absolute capacity prediction capability is lower than experimental techniques by some margin. Thus, experimental measurement of NGV capacity is still regarded as an essential part of many engine programmes. The semi-transient capacity measurement technique, developed and refined at the University of Oxford over the last 10 years, allows rapid and accurate measurement of engine component (typically fully cooled NGVs) capacity at engine-representative conditions of Mach and Reynolds numbers and coolant-to-mainstream pressure ratio. The technique has been demonstrated to offer considerable advantages over traditional (industrial steady-state) techniques in terms of accuracy, time and operating cost. Since the original facility was constructed, the facility has been modularised to allow for rapid interchange of test vane modules, and the instrumentation has been optimised to drive down the uncertainty in NGV capacity. In this paper, these improvements are described in detail, and a detailed uncertainty analysis is presented of the original facility, the current facility, and a proposed future facility in which the uncertainty of the measurement has been driven down to a practical limit. The bias errors of the three facilities are determined to be ±0.535\%, ± 0.495\% and ±0.301\%, respectively (to 95\% confidence). The corresponding precision uncertainties are ±0.028\%, ±0.025\% and ±0.025\%, respectively. The extremely low precision uncertainty in particular allows very small changes in capacity to be resolved. This, combined with rapid interchangeability of test modules, allows studies of the sensitivity of capacity to secondary influences with much greater flexibility than was previously possible. Consideration is also given to the definition of vane capacity in systems with several streams at different conditions of inlet total pressure and temperature. A typical high pressure (HP) NGV has three distinct streams: a mainstream flow; coolant flow ejected from film cooling holes (distributed over the vane surface); and trailing edge coolant ejection. Whilst it is helpful for the coolant mass flow rates and inlet temperatures to be included in the definition, only a relatively small difference arises from the way in which this is achieved. Several definitions appear to share similar usefulness in terms of their robustness to changing inlet conditions of individual streams, but the favoured definition offers the possibility of isolating sensitivities to key effects such as trailing edge coolant ejection. This is achieved by explicitly expressing vane capacity as a function of two controlling pressure ratios. The overall purpose of this paper is to review and analyse in detail the current state-of-the-art in gas turbine flow capacity measurement.},

Tests were conducted in the high technology readiness level (TRL) Engine Component Aerothermal (ECAT) facility at the University of Oxford. High-resolution full-area traverse measurements of local kinetic energy (KE) loss coefficient are presented in several axial planes. In particular, we present circumferential loss coefficient profiles at several radial heights, full-area traverses at three axial planes, and fully mixed-out loss calculations. The analysis of these data gives insight into particular loss structures, overall aerodynamic performance, and wake mixing rates. The effect of exit Mach number on performance is also considered. The data address a gap in the literature for the detailed analysis of traverse measurements downstream of HP NGV engine components. Experimental data are compared with steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations, allowing benchmarking of typical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for absolute loss prediction of cooled components. There is relatively limited aerodynamic performance data in the literature for heavily cooled NGVs, and this study represents one of the most comprehensive of its type.},

  abstract = {The trailing edge (TE) design of a cooled high-pressure (HP) nozzle guide vane (NGV) requires consideration of both cooling and aerodynamic performances. Two designs are in common use: the centered-ejection design, in which coolant is ejected through a slot in the TE with roughly symmetrical suction-side (SS) and pressure-side (PS) TE tips; and the SS-overhang design, in which the SS and PS TE tips are staggered. This second design has been favored in recent years because it has been presumed to be aerodynamically advantageous. In this article, we re-examine this assumption by studying a parametric design set between these two design extremes. We do this using extensive high-fidelity experimental measurements performed at engine-scaled conditions (matched Mach number, Reynolds number, and coolant-to-mainstream pressure ratio) on a full-annular cascade of real engine parts. To provide insight into the mechanisms affecting loss, we use complementary unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.

Experiments are performed for mixtures of carbon oxide and hydrogen with the ratio of the components equal to 1/3, 1/2, or 1/1. The varied parameters are the flow rates of air and syngas, the ratio of these flow rates, and the combustor length. Scalability of the continuous spin detonation process is demonstrated: at identical values of the specific flow rate of air and the combustor expansion ratio, the number of transverse detonation waves increases with increasing combustor diameter. In the examined ranges of combustor lengths and specific flow rates of air, the frequency of these waves is independent of the combustor length, except for narrow regions where the number of waves (and, correspondingly, the flow regime) changes. The structures of transverse detonation waves in regular regimes are almost identical for all examined syngas compositions. It is shown that detonation can be initiated by a jet of combustion products. The minimum diameters of the detonation chamber for different flow rates of the mixture are estimated.},

  abstract = {Based on the actual operation parameters and temperature-dependent material properties of a gas turbine unit, composite cooling blade model and corresponding reliable boundary conditions were established. Transient thermal-fluid-solid coupling simulations were then comprehensively conducted to analyze the transient flow and the temperature field of the blade under startup, shutdown, and variable loads condition. Combined with the obtained transient temperature data, the non-linear finite element method was exploited to examine the effect of these transient operations on the turbine blade thermal stress characteristics. Results show that the temperature and pressure on the blade surface increase with the load level and vice versa. As the startup process progresses, the film cooling effectiveness and the heat convection of airflows inside the blade continuously grow; high-temperature areas on the pressure surface and along the trailing edge of the blade tip gradually disappear. Locally high-temperature zones with the maximum of 1280 K are generated at the air inlet and outlet of the blade platform and the leading edge of the blade tip. The high thermal stresses detected on the higher temperature side of the temperature gradient are commonly generated in places with large temperature gradients and significant geometry variations. For the startup/shutdown process, the rate of increase/decrease of the thermal stress is positively correlated with the load variation rate. A slight variation rate of the load (1.52\%/min) can lead to an apparent alteration (41\%) to the thermal stress. In operations under action of the variable load, although thermal stress is less sensitive to the load variation, the rising or falling rate of the exerted load still needs to be carefully controlled due to the highly leveled thermal stresses.},

  author = {Cantin, Sebastien and Misandeau, Adrien and Chouak, Mohamed and Garnier, François},
  date = {2022-09-29},
  abstract = {The formation of ice-particles in near-field aircraft plumes at cruise altitudes generates contrails. The latter trigger the formation of large cirrus clouds, called aircraft-induced clouds (AICs). These artificial clouds result in a net positive radiative forcing (warming) effect. Furthermore, the use of chevrons in modern jet engines helped to reduce jet noise of 'separate-flow' nozzles; however, the impact of this technology on near-field contrail properties has not been investigated. In this context, this paper presents a CFD-microphysics coupling strategy to model the 3-D dynamics and microphysical transformations in the near-field plume of an aircraft engine. The study investigates the effect of implementing the chevron technology in both fan and core nozzles on plume and ice-particle properties. For this purpose, 3-D unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations were carried out behind a realistic LEAP-1A engine geometry (high bypass-ratio 10.5:1) at cruise conditions. The microphysical modeling accounts for the main process of water-vapor condensation on pre-activated soot particles known as heterogeneous condensation. The plume dilution and ice crystals formation in the engine near-field jet were validated using available numerical and in-flight data to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the proposed modeling strategy. Different geometrical parameters of fan-and core-nozzles were investigated by varying the number and the penetration angle of chevrons. The comprehensive analysis showed that core-chevron nozzles lead to higher kinetic turbulent energy, higher liquid saturation ratio, larger ice particles and thicker contrails than chevron fan-nozzles and the baseline nozzle without chevrons. The proposed model can be hence used in future studies to characterize the impact of tabs or lobed nozzle-exit parameters on the optical and microphysical properties of near-field contrails.},

Here we implement a method that statistically reconstructs the inverse transformation matrix for the fibre. We demonstrate imaging at high frame rates, high resolutions and in full colour of natural scenes, thus demonstrating general-purpose imaging capability. Real-time imaging over long fibre lengths opens alternative routes to exploitation for example for secure communication systems, novel remote imaging devices, quantum state control processing and endoscopy.},

The system employs a continuous planar laser source to excite the fluoresce, and a scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera to capture images of 2048 × 2048 pixels at a frame rate of 12 Hz. While a sliding platform is moving back and forth on the track, a set of images are captured at different positions for 3D reconstruction. In this system, the 3D reconstruction is limited to a maximum measurement volume of about 50 cm × 29.7 cm × 42 cm, with a spatial resolution of about 0.58 mm × 0.82 mm × 8.33 mm, and a temporal resolution of 5 s. Experiments were carried out to detect the PLIF signals from fluorescein aerosols in the chamber, and then 3D reconstruction was used to visualize and analyze the diffusion of aerosol particles. The results prove that the system can be applied to clearly reconstruct the 3D distribution and record the diffusion process of aerosol particles in a confined space.},

This method offers high-resolution results over a considerable surface area, enabling the capture of dynamic flow events with temporal granularity limited only by removable memory card capacity. Multiple WiFi-enabled security cameras, meticulously calibrated with precision-measured reference points on calibration boards, are employed in this methodology. External synchronization, facilitated by strategically-positioned flash lamps, allows calibration among cameras without additional precise tools. Validating our method through an alluvial fan experiment showcases its efficacy in tracking the growth and evolution of experimental debris flows, particularly in capturing the dynamic evolution of debris flow deposits on a growing alluvial fan. This example illustrates the method’s ability to link local flow, evolution, and deposition to multiple channel avulsion events, highlighting its success in capturing distinct slope and height dependencies associated with these phenomena. Overall, our method transcends conventional measurement approaches, providing a significant advancement in capturing the intricacies of rapidly evolving three-dimensional surface topography in particle-fluid flow experiments. Its cost-effectiveness and robustness make it a valuable tool for diverse, dynamic scenarios, presenting a promising solution for experimental laboratory-scale landscape studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Here we describe a combined design, numerical, and experimental program intended substantially to increase the lift and work of low-pressure turbine stages. This exercise is critically dependent upon the appropriate modeling of boundary-layer transition over airfoil surfaces. The effort proceeds through the design of turbine stages consistent with future unmanned air vehicle engine cycles. Then, a series of experiments are described that increase in complexity while driving the technology to more realistic embodiments. Representative experimental data are compared to pre-test predictions of the flow field, and it is shown that acceptable Reynolds lapse behavior is achievable even for turbines with significantly increased lift and work over state-of-the-art systems. Additionally, it is shown that through the judicious use of appropriate flow control technologies, it is possible to improve further the lapse characteristics of very high-lift airfoils. Finally, the benefits of applying such high lift, high work low-pressure turbine components are outlined with respect to a notional aircraft system, and future experiments are proposed.},

  abstract = {The performance of fuel additive candidates to mitigate soot particulate emissions in turbine engines was assessed in a T63 helicopter engine. Seventeen additives, including commercial compounds to reduce emissions in internal combustion engines, diesel cetane improvers, and experimental/proprietary additives, were evaluated. The additives were individually injected into the JP-8 fuel feed to the engine, and evaluated at a minimum of three concentration levels. The engine was operated at two conditions, idle and cruise, to investigate additive effects at different power settings or equivalence ratios. Particulate samples were collected from the engine exhaust using an oil-cooled probe, and analyzed using a suite of particulates instrumentation, which included a condensation nuclei counter (CNC), scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), laser particle counter (LPC) and a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM). Results indicate that the diesel cetane improvers and commercial smoke abatement additives tested had minimal impact on particulate emissions in the T63 turboshaft engine. One proprietary additive was shown to reduce particle number density (PND) by up to 67\% at the relatively high concentration of 3000 mg/l. These benefits were observed only at cruise condition, which may provide some insight into the mechanisms by which the additive suppresses the formation or enhances the oxidation of soot particles. Test results with blends of JP-8 and Norpar-13 (normal paraffins) show significant reductions in particulate emissions for both idle and cruise conditions demonstrating the potential environmental benefits of using blends of clean (low aromatic and low sulfur) fuels with JP-8. Comparisons of mass determination with different instruments and preliminary results of chemical characterization of particulate emissions with and without additives are also presented.},

The test programme comprises three pressure ratios and two Reynolds numbers.The time-averaged radial distributions of total pressure and temperature downstream of the rotor are affected by the hub passage vortices and the interaction between the tip passage vortex and the rotor tip leakage vortex. The azimuthal distributions exhibit significant non-uniformities with a periodicity of one vane pitch. The amplitude of this non-uniformity is very sensitive to the pressure ratio. A simple model shows that, contrary to the common belief, the transport of the vane wake and secondary flows across the rotor is not enough to explain the magnitude of the variations. The pitch-wise vane exit static pressure distribution, which is significantly distorted owing to the transonic regime of the vane, should be taken into account.The amplitude of the time-resolved fluctuations of pressure and temperature, which are due to rotor blade passing events, also varies significantly depending on the probe location in a vane pitch. The measured time-accurate rotor relative inlet total pressure suggests that the rotor relative exit undergoes periodic excursions in the transonic regime.},

The unfueled aerodynamic performance of the RBCC engine flowpath is also presented and compared to sub-scale test results previously obtained in the NASA LeRC lxl Supersonic Wind Tunnel (SWT) and to Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis results. This test program demonstrated a successful configuration of the HTF for facility starting and operation with a generic RBCC type engine and an increased range of facility operating conditions. The ability of sub-scale testing and CFD analysis to predict flowpath performance was also shown. The HTF is a freejet, blowdown propulsion test facility that can simulate up to Mach 7 flight conditions with true air composition. Mach 5, 6, and 7 facility nozzles are available, each with an exit diameter of 42 in. This combination of clean air, large scale, and Mach 7 capabilities is unique to the HTF. This RBCC engine study is the first engine test program conducted at the HTF since 1974.},

The data included measurements of the time averaged and instantaneous surface pressures and surface thin film gage output on both the rotor and stator at midspan. The data also included measurement of the stator suction and pressure surface time averaged heat transfer at midspan. The data was acquired with rotor-stator axial gaps of 15 and 65 percent of axial chord. The upstream potential flow influence of the rotor on the stator was seen as well as the downstream potential flow and wake influences of the stator on the rotor. It was also seen that at the 15 percent axial gap, the stator heat-transfer coefficient was typically 25 percent higher than that at the 65 percent gap.},

  abstract = {The present review describes the current achievements in the applications of a planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) method for the diagnostics of liquid films, bubbles, individual droplets, and sprays. Such flows are related with strongly curved interphases, which often results in additional high errors during the PLIF data quantification because of laser light reflection, refraction, and absorption. The present review demonstrates that a two-color PLIF approach and a PLIF modification for regularly structured illumination resolves the reflection- and refraction-caused errors. The latter modification ensures proper phase separation in the measurement cross-section and visualization of the interface dynamics. The former approach provides the accurate evaluation of the local temperature and concentration both in liquid and gaseous phases even in the case of strong variations of the laser sheet intensity. With intensified cameras, the PLIF method is used for multi-parameter diagnostics of the two-phase combustion of sprays in combustion chambers with optical access. It visualizes and quantifies the liquid fuel evaporation and mixing, to measure temperature in the gas and liquid phases and to reveal the regions of pollutant formation. The PLIF technique can also be easily combined with a particle image (or tracking) velocimetry method, to evaluate local heat and mass transfer.},

  abstract = {Fiber-bundle endomicroscopy has several recognized drawbacks, the most prominent being the honeycomb effect. We developed a multi-frame super-resolution algorithm exploiting bundle rotation to extract features and reconstruct underlying tissue. Simulated data was used with rotated fiber-bundle masks to create multi-frame stacks to train the model. Super-resolved images are numerically analyzed, which demonstrates that the algorithm can restore images with high quality. The mean structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) improved by a factor of 1.97 compared with linear interpolation. The model was trained using images taken from a single prostate slide, 1343 images were used for training, 336 for validation, and 420 for testing. The model had no prior information about the test images, adding to the robustness of the system. Image reconstruction was completed in 0.03 s for 256 × 256 images indicating future real-time performance is within reach. The combination of fiber bundle rotation and multi-frame image enhancement through machine learning has not been utilized before in an experimental setting but could provide a much-needed improvement to image resolution in practice.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of (1) a formula correlating the variation in overall refinery energy efficiency with crude quality, refinery complexity, and product slate; and (2) a methodology for calculating energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities and processing fuel shares of major U.S. refinery products. Overall refinery energy efficiency is the ratio of the energy present in all product streams divided by the energy in all input streams. Using linear programming (LP) modeling of the various refinery processing units, we analyzed 43 refineries that process 70\% of total crude input to U.S. refineries and cover the largest four Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) regions (I, II, III, V). Based on the allocation of process energy among products at the process unit level, the weighted-average product-specific energy efficiencies (and ranges) are estimated to be 88.6\% (86.2\%–91.2\%) for gasoline, 90.9\% (84.8\%–94.5\%) for diesel, 95.3\% (93.0\%–97.5\%) for jet fuel, 94.5\% (91.6\%–96.2\%) for residual fuel oil (RFO), and 90.8\% (88.0\%–94.3\%) for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The corresponding weighted-average, production GHG emission intensities (and ranges) (in grams of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) per megajoule (MJ)) are estimated to be 7.8 (6.2–9.8) for gasoline, 4.9 (2.7–9.9) for diesel, 2.3 (0.9–4.4) for jet fuel, 3.4 (1.5–6.9) for RFO, and 6.6 (4.3–9.2) for LPG. The findings of this study are key components of the life-cycle assessment of GHG emissions associated with various petroleum fuels; such assessment is the centerpiece of legislation developed and promulgated by government agencies in the United States and abroad to reduce GHG emissions and abate global warming.},

  abstract = {Gasoline fraction of Fischer-Tropsch process due to poor quality has a low detonation resistance and high content of olefinic hydrocarbons. This research article introduces novel and simple strategy to produce high-octane alternative fuel based on low-octane gasoline Fischer-Tropsch process via new two-stage processes in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis involving isomerization of alkenes and methoxylation process. Isomerization process became one of the best gasoline production sources, as it gives a high-octane product. The study of the process of isomerization of gasoline Fischer-Tropsch on zeolite is carried out on a flow-through installation with a microreactor. Furthermore, the product of isomerization of gasoline Fischer-Tropsch fraction obtained at the previous stage is used as a feed for the other stage called methoxylation. The reaction for methoxylation process is carried out in an autoclave using a six-fold excess of methanol based on the C4-C7 olefinic hydrocarbons contained in the feedstock. Thanks to the methoxylation process, the product contains high-octane ethers, which made it possible to reduce olefinic hydrocarbons. The resulting gasoline fraction can be used as a base fuel for commercial gasoline, or alternative motor fuel. Further blending of the gasoline fraction with aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols, which can also be obtained by processing synthesis gas, will allow producing high-quality high-octane alternative fuels.},

  abstract = {Aeroengines operate in regimes for which both rotating stall and surge impose low-flow operability limits. Thus, active control strategies designed to enhance operability of aeroengines must address both rotating stall and surge as well as their interaction. In this paper, a previously developed nonlinear control strategy that achieves simultaneous active control of rotating stall and surge is applied to a high-speed three-stage axial flow compression system with operating parameters representative of modern aeroengines. The controller is experimentally validated for two compressor builds and its robustness to radial distortion assessed. For actuation, the control strategy utilizes an annulus-averaged bleed valve with bandwidth on the order of the rotor frequency. For sensing, measurements of the circumferential asymmetry and annulus-averaged unsteadiness of the flow through the compressor are used. Experimental validation of simultaneous control of rotating stall and surge in a high-speed environment with minimal sensing and actuation requirements is viewed as another important step toward applying active control to enhance operability of compression systems in modern aeroengines.},

Animals are capable of manipulating flow around the body and appendages both passively and actively. Passive mechanisms rely on structural and morphological components of the body (i.e., humpback whale tubercles, riblets). Active flow control mechanisms use appendage or body musculature to directly generate wake flow structures or stiffen fins against external hydrodynamic loads. Fish can actively control fin curvature, displacement, and area. The vortex wake shed by the tail differs between eel-like fishes and fishes with a discrete narrowing of the body in front of the tail, and three-dimensional effects may play a major role in determining wake structure in most fishes.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional section of the last stage of a steam turbine has been investigated experimentally in an annular non-rotating cascade facility as regards to its steady-state and time-dependent aerodynamic characteristics at design and off-design conditions.The unsteady experimental data obtained with the blades vibrating in the “travelling wave” mode indicate that one of the main reasons for the flutter susceptibility of the cascade lies in the high expansion and following shock wave close to the blade suction surface leading edge and the corresponding high unsteady loading. The decomposition of the experimental data into unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficients validates this conclusion and gives also that another reason for the flutter susceptibility can be found in the fact that the cascade is overlapped for a part of the blade surface where the local flow velocities are close to sonic.The unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficients show that the instability arises because of the time dependent aerodynamic coupling effects between, essentially, the reference blade and its immediate suction surface and, to a lesser extent, pressure surface neighbors.},

This methodology should be sufficiently general to be exploited for the derivation of Estimation Relationships (ERs) for geometrically sizing characteristics as well as mass, volume and power budgets both for active (turbopumps, turbines and compressors) and passive components (heat exchangers, tanks and pipes). Following this approach, ad-hoc semi-empirical models relating the geometrical sizing, mass, volume and power features of each component to operating conditions have been derived. As a specific case, a semi-empirical parametric model for turbopumps sizing is derived. In addition, the Thermal and Energy Management Subsystem (TEMS) for the LAPCAT MR2 vehicle is used as an example of a highly integrated multifunctional subsystem. The TEMS is based on the exploitation of liquid hydrogen boil-off in the cryogenic tanks generated by the heat load penetrating the aeroshell, all along the point-to-point hypersonic mission. Eventually, specific comments about the results will be provided together with suggestions for future improvements.},

This paper presents a distributed high-speed videogrammetric measurement system suitable for monitoring of large-scale structures. The overall framework consists of hardware and software two parts, namely observation network construction and data processing. The core component of the observation network is high-speed cameras to provide multiview image sequences. The data processing part automatically obtains the 3D structural deformations of the key points from the captured image sequences. A distributed parallel processing framework is adopted to speed up the image sequence processing. An empirical experiment was conducted to measure the dynamics of a double-tube five-layer building structure on the shaking table using the presented videogrammetric measurement system. Compared with the high-accuracy total station measurement, the presented system can achieve a sub-millimeter level of coordinates discrepancy. The 3D deformation results demonstrate the potential of the non-contact high-speed videogrammetric measurement system in dynamic monitoring of large-scale shake table tests.},

All applications have demonstrated improved stability; so far, 9 impellers and up to 21 cover variations have been built. These devices use passive flow control with endwall boundary layer bleed via cover suction plus jet reinjection into various upstream and downstream locations. While the concept feasibility is proven, additional work is needed to develop the design and optimization tools and to discover certain specific control options such as application to diffusers and fluidic control. The devices are expected to be low cost and reliable while offering design flexibility such as reshaping the head-flow curve and the cavitation breakdown characteristic.},

  abstract = {This work presents an innovative design method to obtain valves without moving parts that can be built using additive manufacturing and applied to gas turbines. Additive manufacturing offers more flexibility than traditional manufacturing methods, which implies less constraints on the manufacture of engineering parts and it is possible to build complex geometries like the Tesla valve. The Tesla valve is a duct that shows a diodicity behavior: it allows a fluid to flow in one direction with lower losses than in the other one. Unfortunately the design of the Tesla valve is two dimensional and it relies on the designer experience to obtain good performance.             The method presented here allows the automatic generation of valves similar to the Tesla one, obtained automatically by a topology optimization algorithm. It is the first time that a three dimensional method is presented, the available algorithms in the open literature works in two dimensions. A fluid sedimentation process enables the creation of a new geometry optimized to meet a prescribed set of performance, such as pressure losses. The steepest descent method is used to approximate the integrals met during the calculation process.             The optimizer is used to obtain three dimensional geometries for different multi-objective functions. The geometry is compared to an existing similar solution proposed in the open literature and validated. The results are compared to a Tesla valve to show the performance of the optimized geometries. The advantage of the proposed solution is the possibility to apply the design method with any spatial constraints and for a wide range of mass flow.},

The imposed methods are briefly outlined. The major issues as the roll-up process of the vortex sheet around the wings into the wingtip vortices, the effect of the vortices upon the deformation and displacement of the exhaust jets, and the resulting distribution of the exhaust are addressed. It is found that the roll-up process already significantly displaces the exhaust jets. The evolving wingtip vortices attract the exhaust and collect it around the vortex cores. This entrainment is further controlled by the buoyancy force of the hot exhaust whereas the body of the aircraft, as a source of circulation disturbation, has no significant influence. Histories of temperature and species concentration can be used to determine the duration of the jet regime which, for a cruising B-747 aircraft, lasts for 20 ± 2 s. During that time the temperature of the trapped exhaust decays to the ambient value and then rises again. Likewise, the exhaust concentration drops to 0.03\% of its initial value but then stays constant during the vortex regime. Throughout the jet regime the species are inhomogeneously mixed around the vortex cores with half-moon shaped local maxima. Atmospheric turbulence has no significant impact on the evolution of the wake in the jet regime.},

  abstract = {The transport and effective diffusion of exhaust are analyzed in the wake flow of a large-bodied aircraft which flies through a stably stratified, sheared, and turbulent atmosphere. The analysis is based on data sets from large-eddy simulations of the wake in the atmosphere. Diffusion and dilution measures are obtained from a chemically inert species concentration. Most of the exhaust is concentrated and isolated in the two wing tip vortices (the “primary wake”). However, as the vortices sink through a stably stratified atmosphere, a baroclinic torque develops between the vortices and the surrounding flow and detrains about 10 to 30\% of the exhaust mass from the vortices into the ambient air (the well mixed “secondary wake”). Consequently, the entrainment rates computed for the primary and secondary wakes differ by orders of magnitude. In the period between 1.5 and 3 min the vortices collapse into aircraft turbulence. The trapped emissions of the primary wake are now released and diffused by ambient turbulence and shear. After about 5 min the exhaust concentration has been diluted by 2 × 10−5 and 4 × 10−6 compared to the value at the nozzle exit for the primary and secondary wakes, respectively, and covers areas of about 5 × 104 m2 and 2 × 104 m2. Under flow conditions typically found at cruising heights the emissions are diluted to background concentrations within 2 and 12 hours for wind shear between 0.002 and 0.01 s−1. The spatial plume extension does not exceed the lower mesoscale range (20 km horizontally and 0.3 km vertically). Good to excellent agreement is achieved between the numerical results and in situ measured data.},

The vortices originate from a B-747 aircraft in cruise. Atmospheric turbulence and turbulence originating from the boundary layer around the aircraft are distinguished. The former is weak and anisotropic with eddy sizes in the order of the wing span, whereas the latter is wrapped around the vortices with the maximum intensity at the core diameter. During their descent, the parallel vortex tubes approach each other because stratification and turbulence detrain mass into the ambient air. The atmospheric eddies deform the trailing vortices such that their spacing varies. This, in turn, yields different mutually induced velocities that amplify the deformation quickly according to Crow's instability theorem. The bent vortex tubes link after about 1.5 min and form rings. The continuous trail of turbine exhaust is reorganized in a row of single puffs},

It presents a consolidated European view on the current status of knowledge of the nature and characteristics of aircraft wakes and of technical and operational procedures of minimizing and predicting the vortex strength and avoiding wake encounters. Methodological aspects of data evaluation and interpretation, like the description of wake ages, the characterization of wake vortices, and the proper evaluation of wake data from measurement and simulation, are addressed in the first part. In the second part an inventory of our knowledge is given on vortex characterization and control, prediction and monitoring of vortex decay, vortex detection and warning, vortex encounter models, and wake-vortex safety assessment. Each section is concluded by a list of questions and required actions which may help to guide further research activities. The primary objective of the joint international efforts in wake-vortex research is to avoid potentially hazardous wake encounters for aircraft. Shortened aircraft separations under appropriate meteorological conditions, whilst keeping or even increasing the safety level, is the ultimate goal. Reduced time delays on the tactical side and increased airport capacities on the strategic side will be the benefits of these ambitious ventures for the air transportation industry and services.},

Reaching a high level of confidence in numerical simulations requires that the models have been validated against the experiments. Even though a number of test cases have been established over the past decades, there is still a lack of suitable detailed test data that can be used for validation purposes in particular when it comes to aero damping at high reduced frequencies which is more relevant in the context of forced response analysis. A new transonic cascade test rig, currently undergoing commissioning at KTH, has been designed with the goal to provide detailed blade surface unsteady pressure data for compressor blades profiles oscillating at high reduced frequencies.

  abstract = {Pressure gain combustion is considered a possible path toward improved thermal cycle efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. However, ad hoc turbine designs are required to maximize the thermodynamic potential; the new turbomachinery should be suited for the oscillations in flow conditions generated by the detonation combustor, which are very different from conventional gas turbines. This paper investigates the design, optimization, and analysis of diffusive stator vanes operating under large inlet flow angles in the high-subsonic regime. First, the design methodology is outlined, focusing on the geometric requirements to ingest high Mach number flow and the parametric modeling of the endwall and the 3D vane pressure and suction sides. Then, the impact of the inlet flow angle on the flow field and vane design is studied through a multi-point, multi-objective optimization with three different inlet angles, performed using steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Remarkable reductions in pressure loss and stator-induced rotor forcing are attained while maintaining an extensive operating envelope and high flow turning. Moreover, several design guidelines are provided based on the analysis of the optimized geometries. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is verified with an unsteady assessment of the baseline and optimized vane designs.},

  abstract = {Turbines operating at high pressure in high velocity flow are susceptible to flutter. As reduced frequencies become sufficiently low, negative aerodynamic damping will be found in some modes. Ensuring that the total system damping is positive over the entire turbine operating envelope for all modes is of utmost importance in any design since flutter in a turbine often causes blade failures. This is in contrast to the normal engineering approach, which is to require a positive aerodynamic damping. A unique test campaign with a 1.5 stage supersonic space turbine has been performed. The turbine was operated at simulated running conditions over a large operating envelope in order to map out flutter limits. During the test, flutter was intentionally triggered at seven different operating conditions. Unique data have been obtained during the test that supports validation of design tools and enables better understanding of flutter in this type of turbine. Based on the data the flutter boundary for the turbine could be established. Using CFD tools flutter was predicted at all operating points where the flutter limit was crossed. Both in predictions and as evidenced in test the 2 nodal diameter backward traveling mode was the most unstable. In addition to this predicted values of aerodynamic damping at flutter agreed well with damping estimated from measured amplitude growth.},

  abstract = {Heat treatment of laser powder bed fused (LPBF-ed) Inconel 718 is crucial to achieve desired mechanical properties. Residual stresses, microsegregation, anisotropy, undesirable phases, layered structure, and poor surface quality are the challenges to be faced before LPBF-ed Inconel 718 parts can be industrially implemented. Although heat treatment of Inconel 718 after the LPBF process is widely discussed in the literature, an industrial approach has been neglected, or the proposed heat treatment processes do not address all the aforementioned challenges. Recently, extensive work has been done in the field of high-temperature heat treatment of this material, showing promise. Following current trends, a 4-stage high-temperature heat treatment, developed by considering the industrial approach, is proposed and evaluated in this paper. A structured, microstructural, and mechanical evaluation of the achieved material properties is presented. Several factors were taken into account, including testing orientation in relation to the build direction (0°, 45°, 90°), surface condition (abrasive blasted, machined), testing temperature (21~°C, 425~°C), specimen size (dia. 4.06~mm, dia. 6.35~mm), application of the HIP process (with, without). After eliminating the influence of surface, subsurface and internal defects, the material is characterized with isotropic properties, regardless of testing orientation in relation to the build direction. Isotropic properties are confirmed for both room temperature and elevated temperatures (425~°C). The obtained elongation is {$>$}1.5× higher than the literature reports for heat treated LPBF-ed Inconel 718, while maintaining high tensile strength at the average level found in the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on steady Reynolds Average Navier–Stokes simulations (RANS) of ice particles growth in the near field of a wing-injector configuration. The multiphysics multiphase flow solver CEDRE, enriched with a microphysical model, has been developed in order to simulate the impact of a more real aircraft geometry in contrail formation studies. As a first evaluation case, a simplified aircraft description, i.e. a NACA0012 2D wing with two injectors, has been used. Ice formation has been simulated by assuming water condensation and instantaneous freezing on activated soot particles, initially emitted by aircraft engines. Our investigation focuses on the near field, extending from the nozzle exit until eight wing spans. Although the main goal is to address the question of ice formation, the aerodynamic flow field has been investigated and numerical results compared with existing experimental data. The first results indicate that the exhaust jet is correctly wrapped around the vortex and that the pattern of dilution qualitatively matches observations in the near field. Sensitivity studies to humidity and to the initial soot particle radius have also been performed.},

  abstract = {One challenge for the design and analysis of hybrid electric aircraft configurations is an increased demand in the rejection of excess waste heat. A wing surface heat exchanger concept, which is explored as part of the IMOTHEP project, foresees transferring heat from the propulsive electrical components to the wing surface of the aircraft. Here, heat is mainly dissipated and transported by forced convection. The present study focuses on the analysis of the impact of heat rejection via the wing surface on the wing’s heat transfer and aerodynamic efficiency characteristics. For this purpose, RANS CFD studies of 2D airfoils and a 3D wing propeller geometry of a regional turboprop configuration in representative flight conditions (take off, cruise, and taxi in) are carried out. For each condition, the influence of defining parameters, such as altitude, freestream velocity, angle of attack, surface temperature, and propeller thrust is explored. It is shown that, when increasing the wing surface temperature compared against the freestream temperature, the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing deteriorates for all flight conditions. In reference cruise conditions for example, the lift-to-drag ratio decreases by 4\%, while the average heat transfer coefficient is reduced by almost 20\% when increasing the surface temperature by 300 K. Furthermore, the propeller slipstream enhances the wing’s heat transfer capacity significantly.},

  abstract = {The indirect effects of water vapour (contrails and contrail-cirrus) and particles from aircraft may play a major role in the climate impact of air traffic. The contrail formation is affected by the engine propulsion efficiency, which grows with decreasing exhaust gas temperature. An engine performing with a higher overall propulsion efficiency causes plume conditions which during mixing reach a higher relative humidity for the same ambient temperature, thus causing contrails also at a higher ambient temperature. This paper is aimed at finding technical solutions for the aircraft engines that temporarily decrease the propulsion efficiency, and thereby may alleviate the formation of contrails. Such a measure is to be applied when the aircraft flies through regions where persistent contrails are likely to form. The results suggest that by employing variable guide vanes for the fan of the engine, it would be possible to reduce the threshold formation temperature of contrails by about 1.5 K in the troposphere, corresponding to an altitude of about 300 m. In the stratosphere the beneficial effects are greater. This measure is accompanied by a decrease in overall efficiency by 10–11\% points, giving an increase in specific fuel consumption by 42–48\%, depending on altitude. Sammanfattning De indirekta effekterna av vattenånga (kondensationsstrimmor och kondensationsstrimmor-cirrus) från flygplan kan spela en betydande för flygets klimatpåverkan. Bildningen av kondensationsstrimmor påverkas av flygmotorns verkningsgrad, vilken ökar med minskande avgastemperatur. En motor med högre verkningsgrad ger en plym som när den omblandas med omgivande luft erhåller en högre relativ luftfuktighet för samma omgivande temperatur, vilket resulterar i att kondensationsstrimmor bildas ocksåvid en högre omgivningstemperatur. Denna artikel syftar till att finna tekniska lösningar påmotorerna för att tillfälligt minska motorverkningsgraden, och därmed eventuellt minska bildningen av kondensationsstrimmor. Tanken är att denna motorförändring ska appliceras dåflygplanet flyger genom ett område i vilket sannolikheten för att kondensationsstrimmor ska bildas är hög. Resultaten föreslår att genom att använda variabla ledskenor för motorfläkten är det möjligt att minska “tröskeltemperaturen” för bildning av kondensationsstrimmor med 1,5 K i troposfären, vilket motsvarar en höjd av ungefär 300 m. I stratosfären är de gynnsamma effekterna större. Till följd av denna motoråtgärd minskar motorverkningsgraden med 10–11\%-enheter, vilket ger en ökning av den specifika bränsleförbrukningen med 42–48\% beroende påhöjd.},

However, low recovery factors of FBG total temperature probes at low Mach numbers have been reported, which is very detrimental to improving the accuracy of the total temperature measurement. In this paper, a three-dimensional structure model of FBG total temperature probe is established based on the characteristics of fiber as the temperature sensing element. The temperature distribution under different probe structural parameters, such as the inner diameter of the shield, the position and length of FBG, is analyzed using conjugate heat transfer multi-physics field model. Combined with coupled-mode theory, the spectral characteristics of different FBG parameters and their effects on the recovery factor are analyzed. The structure of FBG total temperature probe with high recovery factor is designed. Comparative experimental results of high-speed airflow show that the improved FBG total temperature probe has a recovery factor exceeding 0.92 from Mach number 0.3 to 0.8, and up to 0.99 at Mach number greater than 0.4, which has even exceeded the level of most traditional thermocouple total temperature probes.},

Considering the marine and atmospheric characteristics of these flight routes, a thermal analysis of the birds’ wings is performed during their migration. The surrounding fluxes including the ocean flux and the solar irradiance are considered in an energy balance in order to determine the skin temperature of both sides of the wing. Applying the Blasius solution for heated boundary layers, it is shown that the color configuration of these migrating birds, namely black on the top side of the wings and white on the bottom side of the wings (“countershading”), results in a skin drag reduction, if compared to some other configurations, when both day and night are taken into consideration. This drag reduction can be considered as one of the effective factors for long endurance of these migrating birds. This research can provide the evolutionary perspective behind the colorization of these migrating birds.},

Such effects are applicable to the efficiency of fixed-wing drones. Experimentally, it is observed that the surface temperature of black birds’ wings is over 50\% higher than white wings under solar radiation. The application of a novel heated top surface on five airfoils results in the drag coefficient decreasing up to 60\% and the lift coefficient increasing up to 70\% for some airfoils in specified angles of attack compared to a non-heated top surface. This method of utilizing thermal effects can be considered as a new applicable way to increase the flight efficiency in fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.},

  abstract = {Unsteady flow around a linear oscillating turbine cascade has been experimentally and computationally studied, aimed at understanding the bubble type of flow separation and examining the predictive ability of a computational method. It was also intended to check the validity of the linear assumption under an unsteady viscous flow condition. Part 2 of the paper presents a computational study of the experimental turbine cascade that was discussed in Part 1. Numerical calculations were carried out for this case using an unsteady Navier–Stokes solver. The Baldwin–Lomax mixing length model was adopted for turbulence closure. The boundary layers on blade surfaces were either assumed to be fully turbulent or transitional with the unsteady transition subject to a quasi-steady laminar separation bubble model. The comparison between the computations and the experiment was generally quite satisfactory, except in the regions with the flow separation. It was shown that the behavior of the short bubble on the suction surface could be reasonably accounted for by using the quasi-steady bubble transition model. The calculation also showed that there was a more apparent mesh dependence of the results in the regions of flow separation. Two different kinds of numerical test were carried out to check the linearity of the unsteady flow and therefore the validity of the influence coefficient method. First, calculations using the same configurations as in the experiment were performed with different oscillating amplitudes. Second, calculations were performed with a tuned cascade model and the results were compared with those using the influence coefficient method. The present work showed that the nonlinear effect was quite small, even though for the most severe case in which the separated flow region covered about 60 percent of blade pressure surface with a large movement of the reattachment point. It seemed to suggest that the linear assumption about the unsteady flow behavior should be adequately acceptable for situations with bubble-type flow separation similar to the present case.},

The main objectives of the present work were to enhance understanding of the behavior of bubble-type flow separation and to examine the predictive ability of a computational method. In addition, an attempt was made to address a general modeling issue: Was the linear assumption adequately valid for such kind of flow? In Part 1 of this paper, the experimental work is described. Unsteady pressure was measured along blade surfaces using off-board mounted pressure transducers at realistic reduced frequency conditions. A short separation bubble on the suction surface near the trailing edge and a long leading-edge separation bubble on the pressure surface were identified. It was found that in the regions of separation bubbles, unsteady pressure was largely influenced by the movement of reattachment point, featured by an abrupt phase shift and an amplitude trough in the first harmonic distribution. The short bubble on the suction surface seemed to follow closely a laminar bubble transition model in a quasi-steady manner, and had a localized effect. The leading-edge long bubble on the pressure surface, on the other hand, was featured by a large movement of the reattachment point, which affected the surface unsteady pressure distribution substantially. As far as the aerodynamic damping was concerned, there was a destabilizing effect in the separated flow region, which was, however, largely balanced by the stabilizing effect downstream of the reattachment point due to the abrupt phase change.},

Supersonic ejectors are ground-based high-speed aerodynamic test facilities characterized by harsh conditions, such as high pressure and temperature gradients. An FBG-based sensor setup was developed consisting of a pressure measuring bare FBG and a specially designed pressure-insensitive FBG temperature probe that can be mounted on the wall of the supersonic ejector. The FBG temperature probe was used for temperature measurement as well as temperature compensation of the pressure measuring FBG sensor. Wall static pressure measurements in the supersonic ejector were carried out at different tank pressures and Mach number flows. The FBG pressure measurements were validated with those of standard piezoresistive-based sensor measurements. Both responses were found to match closely, with FBG sensors having a faster response time and higher pressure resolution. Fluid structure interaction simulation was carried out in Comsol Multiphysics to understand the interaction of high-speed turbulent flow with FBG sensor. The FBG strain profile due to flow-induced stress and its dependence on flow pressure was studied. A detailed analysis of the effect of preceding fiber length on FBG pressure measurement was carried out. FBG sensors, due to their miniature size, ability to withstand harsh environments and multi-parameter sensing capability, can be used in ground-based aerodynamic test facilities with minimal intrusion into the flow.},

  abstract = {Aviation researchers are increasingly focusing on unconventional vehicle designs with tightly integrated propulsion systems to improve overall aircraft performance and reduce environmental impact. Properly analyzing these types of vehicle and propulsion systems requires multidisciplinary models that include many design variables and physics-based analysis tools. This need poses a challenge from a propulsion modeling standpoint because current state-of-the-art thermodynamic cycle analysis tools are not well suited to integration into vehicles level models or to the application of efficient gradient-based optimization techniques that help to counteract the increased computational costs. Therefore, the objective of this research effort was to investigate the development a new thermodynamic cycle analysis code, called pyCycle, to address this limitation and enable design optimization of these new vehicle concepts. This paper documents the development, verification, and application of this code to the design optimization of an advanced turbofan engine. The results of this study show that pyCycle models compute thermodynamic cycle data within 0.03\% of an identical Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) model. pyCycle also provides more accurate gradient information in three orders of magnitude less computational time by using analytic derivatives. The ability of pyCycle to accurately and efficiently provide this derivative information for gradient-based optimization was found to have a significant benefit on the overall optimization process with wall times at least seven times faster than using finite difference methods around existing tools. The results of this study demonstrate the value of using analytic derivatives for optimization of cycle models, and provide a strong justification for integrating derivatives into other important engineering analyses.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been a need for rapid response power generators on aircraft of all sizes. Not only do the current power generators consume a large portion of the aircrafts usable volume, they are also extremely heavy for the amount of power that they can produce; therefore, a need for compact, lightweight Auxiliary Power Units (APU) with high power density has arisen. A novel solution to this problem comes in the form of coupling a Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) with a turbine generator. RDEs operate on an approximately constant volume detonation process, similar to that of the Humphrey Cycle, which has the potential for more power extraction over conventional gas turbine combustors. Previous work on RDE turbine integration has shown promise, but a modification leading to a more compact form with higher power density would be beneficial. Therefore, a new type of RDE referred to as the Radial Rotating Detonation Engine (RRDE) has been developed. This design is based on a disk-shaped device within which reactants flow from the outer radius, detonate, and then exit the inner radius.},

Apart from capturing CO2 directly from the industrial emission sources, the toolbox is now extended to develop technologies to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. Latest development is to target the green transformation by developing and maturing promising technologies that remove and permanently store CO2 from the atmosphere thus generating so-called negative emissions. These are also referred to as climate-positive technologies. This article reviews the studies which have been performed on the available technologies for ''direct CO2 removal from seawater'', also known as ''direct ocean capture (DOC)".},

  abstract = {A significant part of the current aviation climate impact is caused by non-carbon-dioxide emissions, mainly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and contrails. It is, therefore, important to have a holistic view on climate metrics. Today’s conventional, but already well-developed, aero-engines are based on the Joule–Brayton cycle, and leave only limited room for improvement in climate impact. The revolutionary Water-Enhanced Turbofan (WET) concept represents a technical step change addressing all relevant emissions by implementing the Cheng cycle, which combines the gas turbine cycle with a Clausius–Rankine steam cycle. This paper builds upon previous publications regarding the WET concept, and outlines the evolution since then. Promising WET configurations are evaluated according to their ability to reduce global warming potential compared to an evolutionarily advanced turbofan engine. A quantitative approach to estimate reduction of NOx emissions through steam injection is presented. The impact on the creation of contrails is considered using the Schmidt-Appleman criterion. In conclusion, all three climate-relevant emissions can be reduced with the WET concept compared to a technologically similar turbofan in terms of CO2 (up to 10\%), NOx (more than 90\%), and contrails (more than 50\%). The resulting in-flight climate impact can be reduced by more than 40\% when using fossil kerosene, paving the way to climate-neutral aviation.},

  abstract = {The present study focuses on the aerodynamic performance of an aircraft wing with surface heating for thermal management applications. The inclusion of electric components leads to a significant necessity for thermal management. A novel method is examined in this study, in which the heat to be dissipated from an aircraft can be transferred to the boundary layer formed on the wing surfaces of the aircraft and gain some performance benefits on the aerodynamic side. Two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics tools in the framework of design of experiment methods are used to analyze the plausibility of placing a heat exchanger on the wing surfaces from an aerodynamic perspective. The Reynolds number, angle of attack, heat exchanger location, and magnitude of heat flux are considered as the factors; and response surfaces are constructed to identify their effects on the aerodynamics of the surface-heated wing. The simulation results are also used to interpret the significant tendencies indicated by the response surfaces. At the lowest values of the heat flux, the angle of attack, and the Reynolds number, surface heating at the best locations produced a 2.5\% increase in the lift coefficient and a 1.6\% reduction in the drag coefficient.},

  abstract = {During this study, three-dimensional numerical simulations of contrails generated by commercial aircraft in cruise conditions were performed. The objective was to study the early development of contrails in the near field of an aircraft, including engine core and bypass flows. Computational fluid dynamics simulations, based on the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach, were carried out on a realistic aircraft geometry. A microphysical model was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics code to simulate particle growth using an Eulerian approach. Results showed that the mixing processes in the bulk plume were in good agreement with the literature. Then, the early growth of a contrail in the near wake of the aircraft was investigated for two ambient relative-humidity conditions. This parameter played a significant role in contrail local properties. Increased relative humidity led to an increase in the fraction of particles under the supersaturated condition and condensation rate. This resulted in a higher mean particle radius and, as a consequence, in a higher optical depth, making contrails more distinct. Particle-size distribution shifted toward larger particles due to an increase in available vapor and got narrower as the relative humidity increased because more particles were in favorable conditions for ice growing.},

  abstract = {Despite the technological advances that made it possible to create serial commercial micro-turbojet engines with a thrust of up to 1.0 kN, engines of this type in the class of high-speed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) weighing up to 200 kg have not yet received wide distribution. Nevertheless, the use of micro-turbojet engines continues to be considered as promising, and a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of these engines. However, existing studies often show a simplistic approach when a micro-turbojet is considered in isolation from its possible aviation application. The object of this study is micro turbojet engines for high-speed UAVs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of serial commercial micro turbine engines on high-speed UAVs. The task: to select a gas-dynamic calculation program, perform a mathematical modeling of the characteristics of a micro-turbojet engine, and analyze the conditions and effectiveness of the application of the considered type of engine on high-speed UAVs. Method of the study. The GasTurb14 standard program for gas-dynamic calculation of gas turbine engines was used, with the help of which gas-dynamic calculations were carried out, a structural diagram was obtained, and mathematical modeling of micro-turbojet characteristics was performed. The results. Possible manufacturers and models of engines produced by them and their equipment were identified. It was found that for the considering UAV class, the engine should have a pressure ratio in compressor in the range of 4.2-4.7, and it is advisable to choose the flight operating mode of the micro-turbojet engine at a speed of 92-95\% of the maximum. It has also been determined that UAVs with micro-turbojet engines, in comparison with piston engines, easily provide the same flight range with the same fuel relative mass due to at least three times higher speed. Conclusions. The use of a micro-turbojet turns out to be more effective at a flight range of over 300 km, and at a flight speed of more than 150 m/s (540 km/h), a micro-turbojet engine provides a significant advantage over a piston engine for a number of operational and tactical tasks.},

The removal of CO               2               from oceanwater is thus considered a compelling approach to reduce ambient CO               2               concentrations, and potentially achieve net-negative emissions. As an effective means of oceanic CO               2               capture, we report an asymmetric electrochemical system employing bismuth and silver electrodes that can capture and release chloride ions by faradaic reactions upon application of appropriate cell voltages. The difference in reaction stoichiometry between the two electrodes enables an electrochemical system architecture for a chloride-mediated electrochemical pH swing, which can be leveraged for effective removal of CO               2               from oceanwater without costly bipolar membranes. With two silver–bismuth systems operating in tandem in a cyclic process, one acidifying the ocean water, and the other regenerating the electrodes through alkalization of the treated stream, CO               2               can be continuously removed from simulated oceanwater with a relatively low energy consumption of 122 kJ mol               −1               , and high electron efficiency.},

  abstract = {This paper gives a comprehensive insight into gas microturbine (GMT) as a part of microgeneration systems. The gas microturbine is a highly effective source that can operate on various types of fuel, including a low-percentage methane fuel such as biogas or landfill gas. The microturbine is widely used in an industrial, rural and commercial application that can benefit from combined heat and power production as a prime or backup source. A microgrid is a modern way to support decentralised power production. It can operate in off-grid mode or as a tool to stabilise the grid and help with peak-shaving as well as to supply remote areas with generated power. The combination of gas microturbine as a prime mover for the microgrid is a smart solution that can quickly react and implement renewable and new technologies. The GMT can be coupled with solar photovoltaics, wind turbine, fuel cells or combustion engines. Use of these technologies can create a sophisticated, stable and highly effective power system. Based on the findings, the combination of microgrid and gas microturbine is very viable and favourable in terms of efficiency, controllability, stability and variety of applications. This paper provides a survey in the field of gas microturbine, its operation, industrial applications, software for microturbine integration, microgrid operation, and coupling the microgrids with gas microturbines, as well as possible challenges and perspectives for this area of combined power generation.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation of the steady-state and time-dependent aerodynamic behaviour of a compressor cascade in a ring channel was conducted at the Laboratoire de thermique appliquée et de turbomachines (LTT) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. The cascade consisted of 20 blades with a NACA-3506 profile, stagger angle of 40°, and solidity of 0.72 at midspan. Measurements were done for a number of incidence angles over a small range of inlet Mach numbers between ∼0.75 and ∼0.8 in order to examine the influence of an increasing angle of attack on the steady-state and time-dependent pressures. As the angle of attack increased a growing corner stall was observed at the hub and a supersonic zone appeared at the leading edge.The cascade was vibrated in bending mode with a constant amplitude at a reduced frequency of ∼0.42 at imposed interblade phase angles ranging from 0° to 324°, but also with each blade vibrating in a single blade vibration mode. The unsteady data showed that the cascade was in general damped with the minimum damping between ∼−36° to ∼+36° interblade phase angle for all examined incidence angles. The influence coefficient technique was used to identify the damping influence of each of the blades on itself (eigeninfluence) and of blades up and down the cascade (positive- and negative-sided) for different inlet incidence angles.},

  abstract = {Hybrid-electric propulsion architectures provide the infrastructure to enable additional benefits to the propulsion system that are otherwise unrealizable with the sole use of the current, state-of-the-art, gas-driven, turbine engines. The presence of electric machines (EMs) coupled to the shaft(s) of the turbine engine provide the ability to actively alter the operation of the engine to the benefit of the propulsion system and the aircraft it propels. This is the goal of the Turbine Electrified Energy Management (TEEM) concept, which at its broadest level addresses the management of energy across the electrified propulsion system. Prior work has demonstrated the use of this concept to alter steadystate operation and improve transient operability of a hybrid-electric propulsion system. The main benefits previously illustrated include the elimination of stability bleeds and expansion of the turbomachinery design space in order to enable more efficient designs. This paper focuses on the development of control strategies to implement the TEEM concept, and it explores several possible architecture variants for applying this concept. Comparison studies are conducted between a purely gas-driven turbofan (baseline engine configuration) and TEEM augmented variants of the baseline engine. The variants are distinguished by the shaft(s) that possess an EM. The configurations consider EMs on both shafts, an EM on the high pressure spool (HPS) only, and an EM on the low pressure spool (LPS) only. These configurations are referred to as the dual-spool configuration, the HPS configuration, and LPS configuration, respectively. The studies expose several options in configuring and controlling the system, including the use of a single EM coupled to a single shaft of a two-spool engine to positively impact the operability of both shafts. The studies also demonstrate the use of independently designed controllers for the electric machine(s) that allow for a decoupled control design process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Image-based simulation, the use of 3D images to calculate physical quantities, relies on image segmentation for geometry creation. However, this process introduces image segmentation uncertainty because different segmentation tools (both manual and machine-learning-based) will each produce a unique and valid segmentation. First, we demonstrate that these variations propagate into the physics simulations, compromising the resulting physics quantities. Second, we propose a general framework for rapidly quantifying segmentation uncertainty. Through the creation and sampling of segmentation uncertainty probability maps, we systematically and objectively create uncertainty distributions of the physics quantities. We show that physics quantity uncertainty distributions can follow a Normal distribution, but, in more complicated physics simulations, the resulting uncertainty distribution can be surprisingly nontrivial. We establish that bounding segmentation uncertainty can fail in these nontrivial situations. While our work does not eliminate segmentation uncertainty, it improves simulation credibility by making visible the previously unrecognized segmentation uncertainty plaguing image-based simulation.},

The approach is designed to (1) capture photorealistic shapes that accurately model scene appearance from a wide range of viewpoints, and (2) account for the complex interactions between occlusion, parallax, shading, and their view-dependent effects on scene-appearance.},

  abstract = {This perspective proposes a potential pathway to diminish atmospheric CO2 accumulations which is distinct from traditional carbon capture and geological sequestration strategies and from existing negative emissions technologies (NETs). Unlike conventional sorbent- or solvent-based CO2 capture processes where substantial energy expenditures are associated with demixing and desorbing CO2, the single-step carbon sequestration and storage (sCS2) approach relies on electrolytic carbonate mineral precipitation using renewable energy within a simple and scalable process design. Although numerous approaches have implied electrolysis for carbon management, the sCS2 approach is unique in the following ways: (1) CO2 mineralization for promoting solid carbonate formation: The thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to carbonate precipitation are overcome by direct and in situ electrochemical forcing to stabilize dissolved inorganic carbon and divalent cations [Ca,Mg] to form carbonate minerals. (2) Flow-through membraneless electrolysis: A flowing electrolyte (seawater) is dissociated while in motion. The process utilizes cost-effective mesh electrodes while also decreasing the number of components and assembly steps and reducing the risk of device failure. (3) Integrated electrolytic reactor–rotary drum filter: An electroactive thin-film mesh cathode (eTFC) is suggested to be integrated within a rotary drum filter configuration, allowing for the filtration of dilute and polydispersed mineral precipitates at a low energy cost. These attributes render sCS2 as an approach worthy of more detailed evaluation, development, and scaling for global-scale carbon management.},

This study characterizes the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of an ethanol jet in supersonic crossflow and the use of an oblique shock to enhance atomization of the far field plume. Momentum flux ratios of the injectant vary from 0.7 to 7.3 and correspond to the catastrophic breakup regime with Weber numbers above 5000. A baseline converging diverging flow path with a 25.4 mm throat height is installed in a blowdown wind tunnel to produce a Mach 2 air flow, and a 6◦ ramp is included to produce an oblique shock that impinges the spray 15 cm downstream of the injector. Plain orifice injectors of 1 and 2 mm diameter are used to inject ethanol. In the axial plane, a simultaneous Mie-scatter/Laser-induced fluorescence imaging technique is used to measure contours of SMD. A calibration of this technique is conducted with simultaneous phase doppler interferometry measurements, and the convergence characteristics of the mean SMD and signal to noise ratio are computed for every test case. The dynamic behavior and interplay between the injection bow shock, the spray, and the impinging oblique shock is studied through schlieren imaging, and its effect on the droplet size is compared with the baseline configuration.},

In this work, a tri-arc RDE was constructed and tested as an example of noncircular cross-sectioned RDE. The operational characteristics of detonation wave propagation and thrust performance were investigated and compared with an equivalent circular RDE under the same operating conditions. High-speed camera images, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and fast Fourier transform (FFT) were used for the investigation. The tri-arc RDE showed very similar characteristics to the circular RDE but exhibited slightly better stability and propulsion performance than the circular RDE. We consider that repeated curvature changes positively affect the stability of detonation wave propagation. The experimental data show contradicting results from the numerical analysis with a homogeneous mixture assumption in which the detonation pressures at the convex corner were greater than those at the concave corner. It is reasoned that the tri-arc injector design provides a non-uniform mixture composition, resulting in a strong detonation at the convex corner. Overall, the noncircular RDE of a tri-arc shaped cross-section is demonstrated, one which performs slightly better than an ordinary circular-shaped RDE both in detonation stability and performance.},

In the context of well understood advanced airbreathing and liquid rocket propulsion principles and practices, this precept of synergism is advanced mainly through six rather specific examples. These range from the detailed component level to the overall vehicle system level as follows: using jet compression; achieving a high area ratio rocket nozzle; ameliorating gas generator cycle rocket system deficiencies; using the in-duct special rocket thrust chamber assembly as the principal scramjet fuel injection operation; using the unstowed, covered fan as a duct closure for effecting high area ratio rocket mode operation; and creating a unique airbreathing rocket system via the onboard, cryogenic hydrogen induced air liquefaction process.},

  abstract = {A promising method of reducing NOx emissions in combustion systems is the Flameless oxidation (FO), which is based on significant dilution of the oxygen concentration in the reactant stream and elevating its temperature to above auto ignition level. The present work is aimed at developing an FO based combustor for a sequential combustion turbofan engine, where the primary combustor is fuelled with H 2 and the secondary combustor with hydrocarbon (jet or bio-jet) fuel. The work was performed within the framework of the European project AHEAD (www.ahead-euproject.eu). Being situated between the high pressure and the low pressure turbines, the inlet conditions to the FO combustor are non-conventional. CHEMKIN simulations revealed the theoretical feasibility of a combustion system to operate in the FO mode of combustion under the specific Take-off and Cruise operating conditions. Several design iterations were conducted to find an appropriate geometrical configuration that would allow for such a system to operate in a stable manner. The design iterations were followed by CFD simulations (FLUENT) and a final design was an achieved where the predictions indicated nearly uniform internal temperature distribution with low mass fraction of CO and NOx at the exhaust.},

  abstract = {Results of large-eddy simulations of the development of young persistent ice contrails are presented, concentrating on the interactions between the aircraft wake dynamics and the ice cloud evolution over ages from a few seconds to ∼30 min. The 3D unsteady evolution of the dispersing engine exhausts, trailing vortex pair interaction and breakup, and subsequent Brunt–Väisälä oscillations of the older wake plume are modeled in detail in high-resolution simulations, coupled with a bulk microphysics model for the contrail ice development. The simulations confirm that the early wake dynamics can have a strong influence on the properties of persistent contrails even at late times. The vortex dynamics are the primary determinant of the vertical extent of the contrail (until precipitation becomes significant); and this together with the local wind shear largely determines the horizontal extent. The ice density, ice crystal number density, and a conserved exhaust tracer all develop and disperse in different fashions from each other. The total ice crystal number can be significantly reduced due to adiabatic compression resulting from the downward motion of the vortex system, even for ambient conditions that are substantially supersaturated with respect to ice. The fraction of the initial ice crystals surviving, their spatial distribution, and the ice mass distribution are all sensitive to the aircraft type, ambient humidity, assumed initial ice crystal number, and ambient turbulence conditions. There is a significant range of conditions for which a smaller transport such as a B737 produces as significant a persistent contrail as a larger transport such as a B747, even though the latter consumes almost five times as much fuel. The difficulties involved in trying to minimize persistent contrail production are discussed.},

  abstract = {In aerodynamics, the lift-to-drag ratio (or L/D ratio) is the lift generated by an aerodynamic body such as an aerofoil or aircraft, divided by the aerodynamic drag caused by moving through air. It describes the aerodynamic efficiency under given flight conditions. The L/D ratio for any given body will vary according to these flight conditions. For an aerofoil wing or powered aircraft, the L/D is specified when in straight and level flight. For a glider it determines the glide ratio, of distance travelled against loss of height. The term is calculated for any particular airspeed by measuring the lift generated, then dividing by the drag at that speed. These vary with speed, so the results are typically plotted on a 2-dimensional graph. In almost all cases the graph forms a U-shape, due to the two main components of drag. The L/D may be calculated using computational fluid dynamics or computer simulation. It is measured empirically by testing in a wind tunnel or in free flight test. The L/D ratio is affected by both the form drag of the body and by the induced drag associated with creating a lifting force. It depends principally on the lift and drag coefficients, angle of attack to the airflow and the wing aspect ratio. The L/D ratio is inversely proportional to the energy required for a given flightpath, so that doubling the L/D ratio will require only half of the energy for the same distance travelled. This results directly in better fuel economy. The L/D ratio can also be used for water craft and land vehicles. The L/D ratios for hydrofoil boats and displacement craft are determined similarly to aircraft.},

The flow phenomena occurring at steady and pulsating flow injection regimes were analyzed using steady and unsteady two-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes, leading to a precise evaluation of the thermal load and drag reductions. Steady supersonic injection yields the largest abatement in thermal load and aerodynamic drag, while subsonic or fluctuating ones can also provide significant improvements at reduced cooling mass flow rates. Furthermore, a Coanda effect, causing a non-symmetric flow topology, was observed and analyzed for reduced injection port size. This Coanda effect is due to the sudden expansion happening from the injection port to the main flow and it causes the flow topology at the leading edge to become non-symmetric despite the complete symmetry of the problem. This is the first time in the literature such a phenomenon is documented for a supersonic airfoil leading edge injection. Furthermore, it enables the design of novel flow control strategies for the leading edge shock topology and flow structures in supersonic flows.},

In this work, we conduct a well-to-wheels (WTW) analysis of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use of the potential LOF GCI vehicle technology. A detailed linear programming (LP) model of the US Petroleum Administration for Defense District Region (PADD) III refinery system - which produces more than 50\% of the US refined products - is modified to simulate the production of the LOF in petroleum refineries and provide product-specific energy efficiencies. Results show that the introduction of the LOF production in refineries reduces the throughput of the catalytic reforming unit and thus increases the refinery profit margins. The overall efficiency of the refinery does not change significantly because both the purchased energy and the refinery fuel production increase in response to the introduction of the LOF production. The refinery energy efficiency of LOF is approximately 0.8 and 1.6 percentage points higher than that of gasoline and diesel, respectively. Taking into account a 25\% fuel economy gain relative to the regular gasoline internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), the per-mile-based WTW GHG emissions of the LOF GCI ICEV are estimated to be 22\% and 9\% lower than those of the today’s gasoline and diesel ICEVs, respectively; and the per-mile-based WTW fossil energy use is 18\% and 6\% lower than gasoline and diesel ICEVs, respectively.},

We outline a conceptual basis for control, sketching sensors, actuators, and the algorithm. The control of turbulence requires an understanding of turbulent flows beyond our present capabilities, but we describe the physical basis for control of the boundary layer: coherent structures and bursts, the connection between burst frequency and friction velocity, the change of burst frequency and drag reduction possible with polymers or active control, and other effects on burst frequency (e.g. streamline curvature, pressure gradients, and extra rates of strain). Given that the state of the flow must be sensed from the surface, and that this information is necessarily incomplete and aliased, sophisticated techniques may be required to interpret the signals. A control strategy, an algorithm, is necessary, and we express the need for a model of the flow as an interpretor and a predictor. Although surface actuators are necessary, the question of their precise effect on the fluid must be considered. We present surprising results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a type of actuator. Before controlling the fluid, we tried to control a model. As background, we present results of attempts to control several different models.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract We discuss a few applications of active control of turbulent fluid flow and their implications for the economy and the environment. We outline a conceptual basis for control, sketching sensors, actuators, and the algorithm. The control of turbulence requires an understanding of turbulent flows beyond our present capabilities, but we describe the physical basis for control of the boundary layer: coherent structures and bursts, the connection between burst frequency and friction velocity, the change of burst frequency and drag reduction possible with polymers or active control, and other effects on burst frequency (e.g. streamline curvature, pressure gradients, and extra rates of strain). Given that the state of the flow must be sensed from the surface, and that this information is necessarily incomplete and aliased, sophisticated techniques may be required to interpret the signals. A control strategy, an algorithm, is necessary, and we express the need for a model of the flow as an interpretor and a predictor. Although surface actuators are necessary, the question of their precise effect on the fluid must be considered. We present surprising results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a type of actuator. Before controlling the fluid, we tried to control a model. As background, we present results of attempts to control several different models.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Differential fluorescence labeling and multi-fluorescence imaging followed by colocalization analysis is commonly used to investigate cellular heterogeneity in situ. This is particularly important when investigating the biology of tissues with diverse cell types. Object-based colocalization analysis (OBCA) tools can employ automatic approaches, which are sensitive to errors in cell segmentation, or manual approaches, which can be impractical and tedious. Here, we present a novel set of tools for OBCA using a semi-automatic approach, consisting of two ImageJ plugins, a Microsoft Excel macro, and a MATLAB script. One ImageJ plugin enables customizable processing of multichannel 3D images for enhanced visualization of features relevant to OBCA, and another enables semi-automatic colocalization quantification. The Excel macro and the MATLAB script enable data organization and 3D visualization of object data across image series. The tools are well suited for experiments involving complex and large image data sets, and can be used in combination or as individual components, allowing flexible, efficient and accurate OBCA. Here we demonstrate their utility in immunohistochemical analyses of the developing central nervous system, which is characterized by complexity in the number and distribution of cell types, and by high cell packing densities, which can both create challenging situations for OBCA.},

  abstract = {Stereophotogrammetry techniques used in concert with 3D point tracking (dynamic photogrammetry) software are advantageous for the collection of operating data on large wind turbines (or helicopter rotors) over conventional accelerometer-data acquisition systems (DAQ) for several reasons. First, this is a non-contacting technique that doesn’t require the use of mounted accelerometers and electrically noisy slip rings. Second, the optical targets (measurement points) that are mounted to the blade surfaces can remain in place for long periods of time and be used for subsequent measurements without extended/overly complicated setup time. Third, deflection data can be collected on many more points on a turbine/rotor surface beyond what is capable of a conventional multi-channel data acquisition system and accelerometer setup. Operating data has previously been collected on a 1.17 m Southwest Windpower Air BreezeTM wind turbine [1] using Stereophotogrammetry and this data has been used to extract operating deflection shapes from the structure. The purpose of this work is to improve upon the experimental methods used on the 1.17 turbine by Warren [2] and apply these improved methods to a larger, 2.56 m diameter turbine/rotor analog, and collect operating data on the structure. This data was collected outdoors and shape information was extracted from this operating data and compared to that taken with a standard, impact test.},

Cooling the surface delays flow separation and thus is roughly equivalent to an increase in Reynolds number. Conversely heating promotes flow separation and is roughly equivalent to a decrease in Reynolds number. Cooling can also increase the extent of laminar boundary layers. These characteristics might be exploited to identify conditions for which large scale effects occur. The review has found no discussion of the effects of heat transfer on unsteady aerodynamics. From the steady effects some tentative suggestions are inferred about the probable influence of heat transfer on buffet excitation measurements in wind tunnels. Some preliminary wind tunnel tests and some predictive studies are recommended to clarify some of the issues discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Low Reynolds number conditions occur over portions of the operating envelope in the low-pressure turbine section of aircraft engines, leading to a reduction in efficiency due to laminar boundary layer separation. The resulting “Reynolds-lapse” can greatly influence the performance of high-lift high-work low-pressure turbine blades. While the mid-span Reynolds-lapse phenomena has attracted much attention in the literature, the focus of the current paper is on the evolution of separation across the blade span. Extensive experimental measurements were obtained in a low-speed linear cascade arrangement of low-pressure turbine research profiles. Two different high-lift (Zw = 1.78 and Zw = 1.88) high-work profiles were considered. Multiple planes of high-speed particle image velocimetry were acquired to study the development of separation across the span as flow conditions were varied through the Reynolds-lapse curve. In the case of the Zw = 1.78 airfoil, the suction surface boundary layer separation bubble size increases steadily and monotonically as Re is decreased to the lowest Reynolds number measured, Re = 15k. However, the Zw = 1.88 profile experiences a rapid onset of un-reattaching separation at the knee in the curve. A unique four camera composite velocimetry measurement of the suction surface flow was used to capture the progression in separation across the span. A difference in the onset of separation between the two blade profiles was observed. In one case, the separated flow region progressed from the endwall toward the mid-span; and in the other blade set, it progressed from the mid-span toward the endwall. The findings provide a new and deeper understanding of the separation development across the passage of high-lift high-work turbine blades at low Reynolds number.},

The interaction of the jet with the base region alters the flow topology causing pressure bifurcations at the trailing edge that affect the aerodynamic performance of the system and modify the vortex patterns downstream the body. The purpose of this work is to fully characterize the physical effects related to the use of base bleed on the trailing edge of an airfoil at subsonic conditions. Defining a non-dimensional base bleed rate Cb=m˙/ρ∞U∞h, a wide range from Cb=0 to Cb=1 is applied to a simplified model of a turbine blade. The influence of the trailing edge geometry shape is also evaluated, showing that rounded geometries have the potential to minimize the undesirable effects of the injection. Vortex shedding is neutralized when the (non-dimensional) ejected mass flow exceeds the value of Cb=0.8 and Cb=0.55 for straight and rounded geometries, respectively. Additionally, neutralization of the shedding also occurs for relatively low base bleed rates, often accompanied by the onset of a non-symmetrical configuration at the trailing edge. This work has particular relevance in aerothermal gas turbine design, where coolant flow may be ejected at the trailing edge to ensure adequate thermal protection of the airfoils.},

FLASH is based on photolithography, but requires only a UV lamp and a hotplate; no clean-room or special facilities are required (FLASH patterning can even be performed in sunlight if a UV lamp and hotplate are unavailable). The method provides channels in paper with dimensions as small as 200 µm in width and 70 µm in height; the height is defined by the thickness of the paper. Photomasks for patterning paper-based microfluidic devices can be printed using an ink-jet printer or photocopier, or drawn by hand using a waterproof black pen.

  abstract = {In an axial-flow turbine of a jet engine used for aircraft propulsion, the passage vortex (PV) and tip leakage vortex (TLV) generated inside the blade passage deteriorate the aerodynamic performance. In this study, a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator (PA) was installed in the upstream endwall of the turbine cascade to suppress the PV. The effects of the presence or absence of tip clearance and the change in the size of the tip clearance on the vortex structure at the exit of the turbine cascade were observed by recording the flow velocity distributions using particle image velocimetry. In the absence of tip clearance, only the PV existed and was completely suppressed by the PA. By contrast, in the presence of tip clearance, a TLV occurred in addition to the PV. When the input voltage to the PA was varied with various tip clearance sizes, the change in the flow fields where the PV and TLV interfered was clarified. With tip clearance, the PV was suppressed as the input voltage increased; however, the TLV increased considerably. At each tip clearance size, changes in the center positions of the PV and TLV were observed at varying input voltages of the PA. With increasing input voltages of the PA, the center position of the PV moved to the pressure surface side of the tip of the adjacent blade, and the center position of the TLV moved toward the middle of the flow passage. With a larger tip clearance, the amount of movement at the center positions of both the PV and TLV increased.},

An expanding Mach 2 dry-air crossflow is generated through a converging-diverging nozzle with a 25.4 mm by 230 mm wide throat area. A one-millimeter injector with ethanol seeding provides the liquid injection. Injector characteristics and losses are quantified through a calibrated cavitating venturi. Momentum flux ratios ranged from 0.1 to 20, and Reynolds number scaled by the injector diameter ranged from 5,000 to 40,000. A shadowgraph setup with a telecentric lens provides uniform magnification for precise and repeatable measurements from injection to 150 mm downstream of the jet. A Phantom v2012 camera with a frame rate of 20 kHz and shutter time of 285 ns was employed. Light transmittance is defined and calculated for each image pixel with a ratio method paired with no-spray images collected immediately before injection. These values are then related to an attenuation coefficient by incorporating spray width profiles collected with cross-sectional Mie-scatter imaging at multiple axial locations with a burst mode laser.},

  abstract = {In order to observe deep regions of the brain, we propose the use of a fiber bundle for microendoscopy. Fiber bundles allow for the excitation and collection of fluorescence as well as wide field imaging while remaining largely impervious to image distortions brought on by bending. Furthermore, their thin diameter, from 200-500 µm, means their impact on living tissue, though not absent, is minimal. Although wide field imaging with a bundle allows for a high temporal resolution since no scanning is involved, the largest criticism of bundle imaging is the drastically lowered spatial resolution. In this paper, we make use of sparsity in the object being imaged to up sample the low resolution images from the fiber bundle with compressive sensing. We take each image in a single shot by using a measurement basis dictated by the quasi-crystalline arrangement of the bundle’s cores. We find that this technique allows us to increase the resolution of a typical image taken through a fiber bundle.},

“Wave Combustors, which include the Oblique Detonation Wave Engine (ODWE), are attractive propulsion concepts for hypersonic flight. These engines utilize oblique shock or detonation waves to rapidly mix, ignite and combust the air-fuel mixture in thin zones in the combustion chamber. Benefits of these combustion systems include shorter and lighter engines which will require less cooling and can provide thrust at higher Much numbers than conventional scramjets. The Wave Combustor's ability to operate at lower combustor inlet pressures may allow the vehicle to operate at lower dynamic pressures which could lessen the heating loads on the airframe. The research program at NASA-Ames includes analytical studies of the ODWE combustor using Computional Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes which fully couple finite rate chemistry with fluid dynamics. In addition, experimental proof-of-concept studies are being carried out in an arc heated hypersonic wind tunnel. Several fuel injection designs were studied analytically and experimentally. In-stream strut fuel injectors were chosen to provide good mixing with minimal stagnation pressure losses. Measurements of flow field properties behind the oblique wave are compared to analytical predictions.” (Menees et al., 1991, p. 5)
\par
“er, it is not clear that stabilized oblique detonation waves have been established in laboratory conditions \_'5” (Menees et al., 1991, p. 6)
\par
“define an oblique detonation as a wave where the pressure field generated by combustion behind the wave influences the wave itself.” (Menees et al., 1991, p. 6)
\par
“limiting case is an oblique Chapman-Jouguet detonation where the normal velocity component behind the wave becomes sonic.” (Menees et al., 1991, p. 6)
\par
(Menees et al., 1991, p. 6) Just like the figure of Powers, the energy release from detonation "pushes" the wave to be more normal. The limit of this is if there is sonic velocity normal to the wave downstream (then its just a normal shock).
\par
“A one-dimensional engineering code was developed to provide the engine data base for an analysis of Trans-atmospheric Vehicles powered by either ODWE or scramjet engines.” (Menees et al., 1991, p. 6)
\par
“scramjet case, the inlet operates in a four shock mode which gives good performance over all flight conditions.” (Menees et al., 1991, p. 6) Okay, how does a scramjet work? Is that an option?

  abstract = {Microfluidics has enabled a revolution in the manipulation of small volumes of fluids. Controlling flows at larger scales and faster rates, or macrofluidics, has broad applications but involves the unique complexities of inertial flow physics. We show how such effects are exploited in a device proposed by Nikola Tesla that acts as a diode or valve whose asymmetric internal geometry leads to direction-dependent fluidic resistance. Systematic tests for steady forcing conditions reveal that diodicity turns on abruptly at Reynolds number \$\$\{\textbackslash rm\{Re\}\}\textbackslash approx 200\$\$and is accompanied by nonlinear pressure-flux scaling and flow instabilities, suggesting a laminar-to-turbulent transition that is triggered at unusually low \$\$\{\textbackslash rm\{Re\}\}\$\$. To assess performance for unsteady forcing, we devise a circuit that functions as an AC-to-DC converter, rectifier, or pump in which diodes transform imposed oscillations into directed flow. Our results confirm Tesla’s conjecture that diodic performance is boosted for pulsatile flows. The connections between diodicity, early turbulence and pulsatility uncovered here can inform applications in fluidic mixing and pumping.},

In this paper, threedimensional incompressible flow through a Tesla-type microvalve is simulated using FLUENT computational fluid dynamic package. The flow is laminar and SIMPLE algorithm is used. The second-order upwind method is implemented for discretizing convective terms. The diodicity mechanism is investigated in detail for three different microvalves. Effect of several series Tesla-type microvalves on diodicity is also studied. The numerical analyses reveal that the mechanism of diodicity occurs at the T-junction and side channel. If inlet and outlet channels are eliminated, diodicity can be increased by 2. Pressure field analysis shows that the pressure drop is much severe at the junction of the reverse flow compared to the forward flow. The obtained numerical results are compared with those of experimental and a good agreement between them is noticed.},

  abstract = {As aviation is one of the fastest growing industrial sectors world wide, air-traffic emissions are projected to increase their stake in the contribution to global warming. According to studies, both carbon dioxide and contrails are the principal air-traffic pollutants, whereas the impact from contrails in terms of radiative forcing is possibly larger than that of all other air-traffic pollutants combined. New regulations with the objective of mitigating contrail occurrences might cause a change in the design requirements of aircraft. In light of this, a method considering contrail formation during the aircraft design process is presented in this paper. Aircraft performance and optimisation is carried out with NASA’s flight optimisation system. Combining historical meteorological data with air-traffic data enables an assessment regarding contrail formation. As an example, a particular aircraft type in terms of range, speed and payload is optimised for minimum block fuel consumption considering different altitudes. The change in contrail formation in terms of contrail-km formed is calculated. The results suggest that if aircraft of the considered class were designed for higher altitudes, contrail occurrences would diminish slightly at a non-negligible fuel burn penalty.},

  abstract = {Highly loaded aerodynamic devices for propulsion and power generation are emerging to increase power output in a more compact machine are emerging. These devices can experience increased losses due to separation, as in the low-pressure turbine, which arise due to the operation at conditions that increases the adverse pressure gradients ore decrease the Reynolds number of the flow through the device. Therefore, flow control strategies become appealing to reduce losses at these conditions. This work aims to validate flow injection as an effective flow control strategy in the transonic regime. A test facility which was used to study boundary layer separation in a quasi-2d test article was modified to include flow injection and conditions were modified so that the facility was operated in the transonic regime. Valves were chosen which could achieve a wide range of excitation frequencies and the flow control ports were designed to accommodate their nominal flow rate. A preliminary test matrix was built while considering the limitations of the test facility. A numerical study was conducted to identify flow structures of interest and determine a preliminary understanding of the test article. The flow control was then added to the numerical study to guide the experimental set points for injected flow. The response of the flow to continuous slot blowing was characterized, and a 3D simulation with discrete injection ports was done to ensure the set-points determined from the 2D study were viable for discrete injection. Blow-down experiments were then conducted to study the behavior of bulk separation in a transonic regime for a quasi-2D geometry. Once behavior of the separation was understood, steady injection and then pulsated injection were applied in attempts to mitigate the separation. Steady injection was utilized to find the required pressure of injection relative to the total pressure at the inlet of the test article, while the pulsated injection served to identify a frequency at which the time averaged mitigation of separation was greatest. The experiments show that both steady and pulsated flow injection are viable techniques in flow control. It is also shown that pulsation does not allow for a lower pressure injection, but instead allows for the same effect with a lower mass flow requirement. Two-dimensional computational simulations are shown to be effective in determining injection frequencies but not the extent of separation or required injection pressures.},

A SiC coated carbon/carbon (C/C) leading-edge material will not survive that extreme temperature for even a short duration single flight. To identify a suitable leading edge for the Mach 10 vehicle, arc-jet testing was performed on thirteen leading-edge segments fabricated from different material systems to evaluate their performance in a simulated flight environment. Hf, Zr, Si, and Ir based materials, in most cases as a coating on C/C, were included in the evaluation. Afterwards, MER, Tucson, AZ was selected as the supplier of the flight vehicle leading edges. The nose and the vertical and horizontal tail leading edges were fabricated out of a 3:1 biased high thermal conductivity C/C. The leading edges were coated with a three layer coating comprised of a SiC conversion of the top surface of the C/C, followed by a chemical vapor deposited layer of SiC, followed by a thin chemical vapor deposited layer of HfC. This paper will describe the fabrication of the Mach 10 C/C leading edges and the testing performed to validate performance.},

  abstract = {Light field microscopy through bare optical fiber bundles paves the way for depth-resolved fluorescence microendoscopy.           ,              Optical fiber bundle microendoscopes are widely used for visualizing hard-to-reach areas of the human body. These ultrathin devices often forgo tunable focusing optics because of size constraints and are therefore limited to two-dimensional (2D) imaging modalities. Ideally, microendoscopes would record 3D information for accurate clinical and biological interpretation, without bulky optomechanical parts. Here, we demonstrate that the optical fiber bundles commonly used in microendoscopy are inherently sensitive to depth information. We use the mode structure within fiber bundle cores to extract the spatio-angular description of captured light rays—the light field—enabling digital refocusing, stereo visualization, and surface and depth mapping of microscopic scenes at the distal fiber tip. Our work opens a route for minimally invasive clinical microendoscopy using standard bare fiber bundle probes. Unlike coherent 3D multimode fiber imaging techniques, our incoherent approach is single shot and resilient to fiber bending, making it attractive for clinical adoption.},

The proposed turbine facility can operate continuously and also perform transients, suited for precise heat flux, efficiency, and optical measurement techniques to advance turbine aerothermo-structural engineering. The facility has two different test sections, linear and annular, to service both fundamental and applied research. The linear test section is completely transparent for optical imaging and spectroscopy, aimed at technology readiness levels (TRLs) of 1–2. The annular test section was designed with optical access to perform proof of concepts as well as validation of turbine component performance for relevant nondimensional parameters at TRLs of 3–4. The large mass flow rate (28\,kg/s) combined with a minimum hub to tip ratio of 0.85 allows high spatial resolution.

  abstract = {The process of the formation and early evolution of a condensation trail (‘contrail’) in the near field of an aircraft wake was numerically studied by means of a mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian two-phase flow approach. Large-eddy simulations were used for the carrier phase, while, for the dispersed phase, a Lagrangian particle tracking method was used, coupled with a microphysics model to account for ice nucleation. The basic configuration was an exhaust engine jet loaded with soot particles and water vapour and interacting with a wing-tip trailing vortex. The thermodynamic conditions for contrail formation were identified by tracking the spatial distribution of supersaturation around particles. A strong mass coupling between the two phases was demonstrated by the simulations: the condensation of water vapour over soot particles, induced by exhaust dispersion into cold ambient air, leads to the formation of ice crystals whose size grows until thermodynamic equilibrium between the two phases is reached. Finally, local vapour depletion causes significant deviation from the classical mixing line theory and is also responsible for polydispersion of particle radii.},

  abstract = {NASA has undertaken a systematic exploration of many different facets of pressure gain combustion over the last 25 years in an effort to exploit the inherent thermodynamic advantage of pressure gain combustion over the constant pressure combustion process used in most aerospace propulsion systems. Applications as varied as small-scale UAV’s, rotorcraft, subsonic transports, hypersonics and launch vehicles have been considered. In addition to studying pressure gain combustor concepts such as wave rotors, pulse detonation engines, pulsejets, and rotating detonation engines, NASA has studied inlets, nozzles, ejectors and turbines which must also process unsteady flow in an integrated propulsion system. Other design considerations such as acoustic signature, combustor material life and heat transfer that are unique to pressure gain combustors have also been addressed in NASA research projects. In addition to a wide range of experimental studies, a number of computer codes, from 0-D up through 3-D, have been developed or modified to specifically address the analysis of unsteady flow fields. Loss models have also been developed and incorporated into these codes that improve the accuracy of performance predictions and decrease computational time. These codes have been validated numerous times across a broad range of operating conditions, and it has been found that once validated for one particular pressure gain combustion configuration, these codes are readily adaptable to the others. All in all, the documentation of this work has encompassed approximately 170 NASA technical reports, conference papers and journal articles to date. These publications are very briefly summarized herein, providing a single point of reference for all of NASA’s pressure gain combustion research efforts. This documentation does not include the significant contributions made by NASA research staff to the programs of other agencies, universities, industrial partners and professional society committees through serving as technical advisors, technical reviewers and research consultants.},

  abstract = {Advanced predictions of blade flutter have been continually pursued. It is noted however that validation cases of unsteady CFD methods against experimental cases with detailed 3D unsteady pressures are still rather lacking. The main objectives of the present work are two-folds. First, validate and understand the characteristics of blade tip clearance, as well as a bubble-type flow separation for an unsteady CFD solver against a 3D oscillating cascade experiment. And second, examine the applicability of the influence coefficient method (ICM) as widely used in an oscillating linear cascade setup. In the first part, the capability of a widely used commercial solver (CFX) for unsteady flows induced by a 3D oscillating compressor cascade is examined. The present computations have shown consistently a destabilizing effect of increasing blade tip clearance, in agreement with the experiment. More remarkably, the computational analyses reveal a distinctive interplay between the inlet endwall boundary layer and the tip clearance in relation to the aerodynamic damping. Different inlet endwall boundary layer thicknesses are shown to lead to qualitatively different aeroelastic stability characteristics in relation to tip clearance. The aero-damping variation with the tip clearance under the influence of the inlet endwall boundary layer seems to correlate closely to a balancing act between the passage vortex and the tip leakage vortex. The tip clearance aeroelastic behavior seems also in line with a simple quasi-steady analysis. On the other hand, the mid-chord laminar bubble separation on suction surface, though with a clear signature in the local aero-damping, has negligible effects on the overall stability. The second part aims to examine computationally the applicability of the influence coefficient method in a linear cascade setup. The comparison between the cascade-based ICM data and a baseline “tuned cascade” shows that the differences in the sensitivity to the far-field treatment can be significant, depending on inter-blade phase angles. On the other hand, non-linearity effects closely relevant to the basic linear assumption of the ICM are shown to only have a small influence. The present results suggest that extra caution should be exercised when comparing a CFD-based tuned cascade model with a finite cascade-based ICM model, at conditions close to acoustic resonance. The resultant discrepancies may well arise from the inherently different far-field sensitivities between the two models, rather than those typical numerical and physical modeling aspects of interest (e.g., meshing, spatial and temporal discretization errors as well as turbulence modeling).},

It is desirable for engineers to use numerical simulations be able to accurately predict the heat transfer inside of a gas turbine casing during engine shutdown. This will help them to understand and alleviate problems such as engine casing distortion. A natural convection test rig was constructed to provide simulation validation data. The rig represented a section of a large gas turbine casing and operated at the same Rayleigh number as a real engine. The casing rig was able to provide a unique dataset that could not be obtained through real engine measurements. Analysis of the casing rig was performed using a large eddy simulation and RANS simulations. It was found that the baseline RANS simulation did not predict the heat transfer accurately enough for engineering use. The simple gradient diffusion hypothesis (SGDH) turbulent heat flux model used in the baseline simulations was replaced by more advanced generalised gradient diffusion hypothesis (GGDH). A modification to the GGDH model, called GGDH+, was developed to account for buoyancy effects on the turbulent heat flux. The GGDH+ model was then able to give heat transfer predictions comparable to the LES results.},

The model does not include, for example, geometric distortions or blurring of unfocused objects caused by lenses and finite sized apertures.  It also does not take into account that most practical cameras have only discrete image coordinates.  This means that the pinhole camera model can only be used as a first order approximation of the mapping from a 3D scene to a 2D image.  Its validity depends on the quality of the camera and, in general, decreases from the center of the image to the edges as lens distortion effects increase. Some of the effects that the pinhole camera model does not take into account can be compensated, for example by applying suitable coordinate transformations on the image coordinates; other effects are sufficiently small to be neglected if a high quality camera is used.  This means that the pinhole camera model often can be used as a reasonable description of how a camera depicts a 3D scene, for example in computer vision and computer graphics.},

Here videogrammetry is used to analyze the spectral content of the motion of a flexible Nighthawk mini-unmanned aerial vehicle wing and animate the operating deflection shapes of the wing corresponding to structural resonance frequencies. The wing was tested at angles of attack ranging from -5 to 13 deg and wind speeds ranging from 20 to 40 mph. Results show that the flexible wing tends to experience flapping behavior at frequencies much lower than structural resonance at low angles of attack. This behavior is confirmed by the spectral content of the wing displacements and the corresponding animated deflection shapes. This analysis uses videogrammetry data in the spectral analysis and visualization of resonance shapes. The data are necessary to validate numerical models of the wings, understand complicated membrane-structure interactions, and optimize wing performance in different flight regimes.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity of rotating detonation combustor operation and performance to oxidizer injector pressure drop was characterized using continuous variation of the injector area during combustor operation. As the oxidizer injector area was both increased and decreased, the sensitivity of the combustion process to varying injector pressure drop was characterized using high-frequency measurements of pressure and chemiluminescence intensity. Detonation wave strength and coherence were characterized using peak-to-peak intensity and power fraction calculated from point-chemiluminescence measurements. Propulsive performance of the combustor was evaluated using thrust and equivalent available pressure, relating them back to reactant supply pressures for assessment of combustor pressure gain. Pressure gain increased during a test as the oxidizer injector area was increased and the corresponding manifold pressure was decreased. At larger injector areas, pressure gain decreased as the operating mode of the combustor transitioned from detonation to deflagration, concomitant with a reduction of gross thrust. Modeling of injector recovery time revealed that the injector operated in both choked and unchoked regimes, which was used to explain detonation wave number transitions in the experiment. A broadened range of detonative operability enabled by active variation of combustor geometry resulted in higher performance with a lower injector pressure drop.},

  abstract = {The radiative characteristics and lifetimes of contrails are dependent on the number concentration of ice-forming particles in the engine exhaust plume. Aircraft gas turbine engines produce a variety of particles, yet it is understood that non-volatile black carbon aggregates are the dominant source of ice-forming particles with typical, fossil-derived jet fuel. However, with cleaner combustion technologies and the adoption of alternative fuels (e.g. hydrogen or synthetic aviation fuel), non-volatile black carbon particle emissions are expected to decrease or even be eliminated. Under these conditions, contrail properties will depend upon the concentration and characteristics of particles other than black carbon. Ultrafine (\&lt; 100 nm) jet lubrication oil droplets constitute a significant fraction of the total organic particulate matter released by aircraft; however, their ability to form contrail ice crystals has hitherto been unexplored. In this work, we experimentally investigate the activation and freezing behaviour of lubrication oil droplets using an expansion chamber, assessing their potential as ice-forming particles. We generate lubrication oil droplets with a geometric mean mobility diameter of (100.9 ± 0.6) nm and show that these activate to form water droplets, which subsequently freeze when the temperature is below ∼ 235 K. We find that nucleation on lubrication oil droplets should be considered in future computational studies – particularly under soot-poor conditions – and that these studies would benefit from particle size distribution measurements at cruise altitude. Overall, taking steps to reduce lubrication oil number emissions would help reduce the climate impact of contrail cirrus.},

“1991” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1)
\par
“Proposals have been made to utilize stabilized oblique detonation waves (ODWs) for the propulsion of hypersonic air-breathing vehicles and hypervelocity mass launchers. There exists hypersonic flight regimes where premixing of fuel and air may be desirable or unavoidable due to finite chemical induction times. Consequently, it is essential to understand under what conditions detonations may occur in order to design supersonic combustors to either avoid or utilize them efficiently. A theoretical analysis is made of supersonic flow of a combustible gas mixture past a wedge or an inclined wall, which shows that, for approach velocities roughly 25\% or more greater than the Chapman-Jouguet velocity of the reactant mixture, there exists a usefully wide range of turning angles within which ODWs may be attached or stabilized. For smaller wedge angles, either an incomplete ODW, shock-induced combustion, or no combustion at all may ensue. For larger wedge angles, the wave will detach and form an overdriven normal detonation or normal shock-induced combustion wave immediately upstream of the stagnation point, decaying off axis to either a single oblique Chapman-Jouguet wave, or bifurcating to form an oblique shock followed by a shock-induced deflagration.” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1)
\par
“the difficulty of stabilizing an NDW in steady flow5'8 appeared to necessitate variable engine geometry for propulsion applications” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1)
\par
“As a result, the NDW cycle performance falls off sharply with flight Mach numbers above 6.” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1) Is NDW an option for us? We are slower than Mach 6
\par
“premixing may be necessary for SCRJ combustion in the flight Mach number range 8-16.” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1)
\par
“attempts to stabilize oblique detonation waves were reported in the late 1950s and early 1960s.” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1)
\par
“reported experimental results were very controversial and their interpretation was clouded by semantic arguments over the definition of the term "detonation."” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 1) lol
\par
“it is the objective of the present paper to clarify the interactions between thermodynamic, chemicalkinetic, and gasdynamic considerations that determine the required envelope of operating parameters within which a stable ODW with acceptable total pressure loss can be realized, and to critically review the existing literature in light of this understanding” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 2)
\par
“When a shock-induced combustion wave follows so closely on the igniting shock wave that the two waves are fully pressure coupled, the resulting shock/ combustion wave structure is a detonation” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 2)
\par
“Detonation waves will be further classified as overdriven, Chapman-Jouguet (C-J), or underdriven, depending on whether the normal component of flow velocity following the wave is subsonic, sonic, or supersonic, respectively” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 2) Approach {$>$} CJ : SuperDetonative
\par
(Pratt et al., 1991, p. 3) 3 Regions:\\
1. Strong (Always Overdriven)\\
2. Weak Underdriven: M2n {$<$} 1\\
3. Weak Overdriven: M2n {$>$} 1\\
The "CJ" condition (M2n = 1) is the limiting case, and corresponds to the LEAST turning/strength of the oblique wave you can have. It is also a unique solution, as you increase M1n you get two solutions (Overdriven or Underdriven)

We want UNDERDRIVEN
\par
“for any given Mach number MI, specific heat release Qt and initial static temperature 7\textbackslash, the C-J point represents the minimum turning angle 6 for which stable heat release Q can occur” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par
“although M2n {$<$} 1is a necessary condition for an ODW to attach or stabilize, it is not sufficient” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par
“overdriven normal detonation or a normal shock-induced combustion wave will form just upstream” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par
“effect of increasing amounts of heat release is therefore seen to reduce the range of permitted turning angles for attached oblique waves” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par
“a normal C-J detonation wave would stand in the flow, which would cause it to be thermally choked with M2= 1” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par
“the smallest amount of heat release possible provides the least thermal occlusion to the flow” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)

“inherently superdetonative character of stable ODWs: at approach velocities below the C-J Mach number for the reactive mixture, no stable ODW is possible” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par
“that superdetonative approach velocities—roughly 25\% in excess of the C-J velocity—are required for the existence of a useful range of turning angles” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 4)
\par

\par
(Pratt et al., 1991, p. 5) Hotter Inlet Temp = Increased possibility of stoichiometric combustion\\
Higher Mach = same thing
\par
“C-J turning angle corresponds to the minimum total pressure loss for given approach conditions” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 5)
\par
“predominant source of mechanical energy to support an ODW thus comes from the freestream” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 5)
\par
“As the approach Mach number is increased, the ratio of energy supplied by exothermic chemical reaction to that supplied by the freestream decreases, because the heat released by combustion is fixed by the stoichiometric mixture ratio” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 5)
\par
“overdriven ODWs are stable for any amount of heat release, as is the case for nohreacting attached oblique shocks” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 6)
\par
“In the case of underdriven waves, for which M2n {$>$} 1, Eq. (35) shows that downstream Mach waves diverge from the oblique shock wave” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 6) If M2N is 1, the Mach wave downstream of the oblique wave is exactly parallel.\\
If M2N {$<$} 1: Stable!\\
if M2N {$>$} 1: Unstable, Mach wave is "blown away"
\par
“either normal shock-induced combustion or a normal detonation wave will occur immediately upstream of the object, with maximum (normal shock or detonation) strength along the stagnation streamlin” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 6) For blunt LE (Normal Shock!)
\par
(Pratt et al., 1991, p. 6) Point 2 is Underdriven, it can either go to:

2': No Detonation (maybe shock induced combustion)

2'': Partial Heat Release (Incomplete Detonation)
\par
“For any given fuel-air mixture and freestream temperature, there exists a unique specific heat release Q, and a corresponding MCJ, which would result for complete (or equilibrium) combustion. For approach Mach numbers roughly 25\% in excess of Mcj, there exists a usefully wide range of turning angles between 0cj and 0max within which ODWs may be attached and stabilized.” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 8)
\par
“Consequently, the Chapman-Jouguet condition has significance only as a limiting design state for stable operation or flameholding. Destructive oscillatory instabilities that may arise in subdetonative flow regions may be avoided by designing *to insure that oblique detonations are slightly overdriven, which can be achieved at little cost of total pressure compared to the minimum-total-pressure loss Chapman-Jouguet state.” (Pratt et al., 1991, p. 8)},

  abstract = {The aerodynamic damping calculations for turbomachinery blade aeromechanics applications are typically carried out in an isolated blade row. The aerodynamic damping of vibrating blades, however, can be significantly influenced by the presence of neighboring blade rows. A highly efficient frequency-domain method is used to investigate the multirow effects on the blade row aerodynamic damping of a compressor and turbine. Depending on the blade profile orientations, the flow reflection effects from adjacent blade rows can significantly alter both unsteady pressure amplitudes and phase angles. Therefore, the blade aerodamping might increase or decrease depending on the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of the unsteady pressure changes. In the case of the compressor, the downstream stator significantly changes the unsteady pressure distribution on the rotor thus, affects the rotor aerodamping. In the turbine case, the upstream stator has a major effect on the aerodamping, while the downstream stator does not significantly change the rotor aerodamping.},

Greater understanding of factors influencing contrail properties are required if routes to mitigation are to be explored. In this work, a parametric turbofan powered aircraft model has been created to study the impact that aircraft design, in particular the interaction between the jet and wingtip vortex, can have on ice crystal formation, growth, and dynamics within a contrail. To investigate this, a contrail microphysics module has been developed and integrated within Rolls-Royce in-house Hydra computational fluid dynamics code. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are conducted over the jet and early vortex regime, covering an area which is often simplified in most contrail modeling approaches. It is found that the position of the engine along the wing of an aircraft can impact the formation of the wingtip vortex, altering the contrail properties and distribution downstream of the aircraft. The effect of multi-engine architecture is also assessed and shown to influence the magnitude of exhaust entrainment into the vortex.},

Analysis of these data reveal that turbine efficiency under pulsedetonation-combustor-fired operation was indistinguishable from steady performance within the 8 points measurement uncertainty. Furthermore, the pulse-detonation-combustor-turbine hybrid system demonstrated a potential 25\% improvement in efficiency once corrections were made for the suboptimal fueling design, which resulted in lower-than-anticipated combustion efficiency. The present work is promising as it suggests that a pulsedetonation-combustor-turbine hybrid engine performance benefit can be realized with further development.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation is made into the active control of the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer (\$Re\_\textbackslash theta \textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash, 1960\$) using a linear active control scheme. System identification in the boundary layer provides optimal transfer functions that predict the downstream characteristics of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. Enhanced detection techniques isolate the large-scale turbulent motion and improve the downstream correlations, resulting in greater controllability. The control is applied using a spanwise array of resonant synthetic jet actuators that introduce pairs of streamwise vortices into the flow. Control results show that a maximum reduction of 30\% in the streamwise velocity fluctuations is achieved. This reduction is greatest at the point of optimization but spans a few hundred viscous lengths downstream of the actuator, about 50 viscous lengths in the wall-normal direction and 150 viscous lengths in the spanwise direction. The wall pressure fluctuation and the mean wall shear stress (measured approximately using mean velocity profiles near the wall) were reduced by 15\% and 7\% respectively. The bursting frequency, based on VITA event detection was also reduced by up to 23\%.},

  abstract = {Future terrestrial and interplanetary travel will require high-speed flight and reentry in planetary atmospheres by way of robust, controllable means. This, in large part, hinges on having reliable propulsion systems for hypersonic and supersonic flight. Given the availability of fuels as propellants, we likely will rely on some form of chemical or nuclear propulsion, which means using various forms of exothermic reactions and therefore combustion waves. Such waves may be deflagrations, which are subsonic reaction waves, or detonations, which are ultrahigh-speed supersonic reaction waves. Detonations are an extremely efficient, highly energetic mode of reaction generally associated with intense blast explosions and supernovas. Detonation-based propulsion systems are now of considerable interest because of their potential use for greater propulsion power compared to deflagration-based systems. An understanding of the ignition, propagation, and stability of detonation waves is critical to harnessing their propulsive potential and depends on our ability to study them in a laboratory setting. Here we present a unique experimental configuration, a hypersonic high-enthalpy reaction facility that produces a detonation that is fixed in space, which is crucial for controlling and harnessing the reaction power. A standing oblique detonation wave, stabilized on a ramp, is created in a hypersonic flow of hydrogen and air. Flow diagnostics, such as high-speed shadowgraph and chemiluminescence imaging, show detonation initiation and stabilization and are corroborated through comparison to simulations. This breakthrough in experimental analysis allows for a possible pathway to develop and integrate ultra-high-speed detonation technology enabling hypersonic propulsion and advanced power systems.},

  abstract = {Rotating Detonation Combustion is a promising technology with the potential to significantly enhance thermodynamic efficiency and reduce the footprint of propulsion and power generation systems. However, the inherent fluctuations in flow properties, caused by the motion of the detonation wave, result in strong, unsteady behavior. This dynamic characteristic, combined with the extreme power density of RDCs, leads to a compact combustor size but presents considerable challenges for effective thermal management. The objective of this study is to provide a thorough design methodology for an air-cooled RDC that can be integrated into the Rolls-Royce M250-C40B gas turbine engine. To avoid the unexplored effects of film cooling on detonation physics and combustor operability, a pressure vesselliner convection cooling architecture was selected. Additionally, a transition duct was integrated to introduce dilution airflow and ensure adequate turbine inlet conditions. A one-dimensional thermal model based on Bartz's Nusselt number correlation was developed to facilitate the rapid evaluation of different materials, temperature profiles, and geometric parameters, as well as to estimate the heat fluxes on the combustor walls. The results of the 1D analysis were subsequently used to define boundary conditions for the design and computational assessment of the transition duct, which was carried out using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. The numerical predictions were compared with the turbine inlet conditions of the M250-C40B engine. Following this, transient thermostructural finite element analyses were conducted for both the combustor and transition duct components to determine the most suitable materials and cooling designs.},

To increase the energy efficiency and reduce the fuel consumption, waste heat recovery is a significant method for energy saving. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has great potential to recover the waste heat from the core jet exhaust of a turbofan engine and use it to produce power. Preliminary study of the design concept and thermodynamic performance of this ORC system would assist researchers to predict the benefits of using the ORC system to extract the exhaust heat engine. In addition, a mathematical model of the heat transfer of this ORC system is studied and developed. The results show that with the increment of exhaust heat temperature, the mass flow rate of the working fluid, net power output and the system thermal efficiency will also increase. Consequently, total consumption of jet fuel could be significantly saved as well.},

  abstract = {The steady improvement of aircraft engine performance has led toward more compact engine cores with increased structural loads. Compact single-stage high-pressure turbines allow high power extraction, operating in the low supersonic range. The shock waves formed at the airfoil trailing edge contribute substantially to turbine losses, mainly due to the shock-boundary layer interactions as well as high-frequency forces on the rotor. We propose to control the vane trailing edge shock interaction with the downstream rotor, using a pulsating vane-trailing-edge-coolant at the rotor passing frequency. A linear cascade of transonic vanes was investigated at different Mach numbers, ranging from subsonic to supersonic regimes (0.8, 1.1) at two engine representative Reynolds numbers (4\,×\,106 and 6\,×\,106). The steady and unsteady heat flux was retrieved using thin-film two-layered gauges. The complexity of the tests required the development of an original heat transfer postprocessing approach. In a single test, monitoring the heat flux data and the wall temperature we obtained the adiabatic wall temperature and the convective heat transfer coefficient. The right-running trailing edge shock wave impacts on the neighboring vane suction side. The impact of the shock wave on the boundary layer creates a separation bubble, which is very sensitive to the intensity and angle of the shock wave. Increasing the coolant blowing rate induces the shock to be less oblique, moving the separation bubble upstream. A similar effect is caused by the pulsations of the coolant},

  abstract = {Positions of vortices shed by a full-scale UH-60A rotor in forward flight were measured during a test in the National Full- Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA Ames Research Center. Vortices in a region near the tip of the advancing blade were visualized from two directions by Retro-Reflective Background-Oriented Schlieren (RBOS). Correspondence of points on the vortex in the RBOS images from both cameras was established using epipolar geometry. The object-space coordinates of the vortices were then calculated from the image-plane coordinates using stereo photogrammetry. One vortex from the tip of the blade that had most recently passed was visible in most of the data. The visibility of the vortices was greatest at high thrust and low advance ratios. At these favorable conditions, vortices from the most recent passages of all four blades were detected. The vortex positions were in good agreement with PIV data for a case where PIV measurements were also made. RBOS and photogrammetry provided measurements of the angle at which each vortex passed through the PIV plane.},

  abstract = {The Pollution From Aircraft Emissions in the North Atlantic Flight Corridor (POLINAT) projects were undertaken to investigate the impact of aircraft engine exhaust emissions on the state of the atmosphere in the North Atlantic flight corridor. Changes in the composition of the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere from aircraft emissions are identified from combined measurements and model analyses. Measurements were performed using the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt Falcon research aircraft and a Swissair B-747 over the North Atlantic covering the altitude range 6 to 13 km in November 1994 and June/July 1995 and from August to November 1997. The measurements include those of nitrogen oxides, nitrous and nitric acids, sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, acetone, carbon dioxide, ozone, water vapor, carbon monoxide, aerosols, and meteorological parameters. The atmospheric composition was found to be highly variable, and emissions from sources at the surface or from lightning discharges also contribute strongly to the nitrogen oxides abundance and ozone formation. Contributions from aircraft emissions have been measured and identified in single and multiple plumes of several hours ages, and accumulation of such nitrogen oxides and particles emissions can be identified under certain conditions in and downstream of the flight corridor region. Acetone was found at high mixing ratios. The global and regional models predict ozone increases of 3 to 6\% by current air traffic at the flight corridor altitude north of 30°N, in agreement with previous model analyses but too small to be measurable. In autumn, the upper troposphere is often humid with water vapor concentration far above ice saturation, providing conditions for persistent contrails.},

Feasible routes using flow instability as an efficiency enhancement tool are discussed as an emerging means to explain the physical phenomena of active flow-control and as a tool for control law design and development. Traditional and more recent theoretical approaches to control design are discussed and recommendations are made relevant to numerical complications on the route to design oscillatory flow-control systems.

  abstract = {Flutter is a self-excited and self-sustained aero-elastic instability, caused by the positive feedback between structural vibration and aerodynamic forces. A two-passage linear turbine cascade was designed, built, and tested to better understand the phenomena and collect data to validate numerical models. The cascade featured a center airfoil that had its pitch axis as a degree-of-freedom to enable coupling between the air flow and mechanical response in a controlled manner. The airfoil was designed to be excited about its pitch axis using an electromagnetic actuation system over a range of frequencies and amplitudes. The excitation force was measured with load cells, and the airfoil motion was measured with accelerometers. Extraordinary effort was taken to minimize the mechanical damping so that the damping effects of the airflow over the airfoil, that were of primary interest, would be observable. Assembling the cascade required specialized alignment procedures due to the tight clearances and large motion. The aerodynamic damping effects were determined by observing changes in the mechanical frequency response of the system. Detailed aerodynamic and mechanical measurements were conducted within a wide range of Mach numbers (Ma) from Ma\,=\,0.10 to 1.20. Experimental results indicated that the aerodynamic damping increased from Ma\,=\,0.10 to 0.65, dropped suddenly, and was then constant from Ma\,=\,0.80 to 1.20. A flutter condition was identified in the interval between Ma\,=\,0.65 and Ma\,=\,0.80. The aerodynamic damping was also found to be independent of displacement amplitude within the tested range, giving credence to linear numerical approaches.},

  abstract = {The Rocket-based Combined-cycle (RBCC) engine is regarded as one of the most efficient propulsion systems for reusable space transportation vehicles and hypersonic cruise vehicles. It can perform excellently over a very broad range of Mach numbers and flight altitudes through multi-mode operations by effectively integrating the high thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket engine and the high specific impulse of the airbreathing engine. As one of the most distinctive features and advantages of an RBCC engine, the ejector mode is an important mode for supporting the flight vehicle's rapid acceleration and climb. The engine performance, especially the specific impulse in the ejector mode, plays a vital role in determining the majority of the total fuel consumption, the propulsion efficiency of the entire RBCC engine, and further the whole flight trajectory. Therefore, an excellent performance in the ejector mode sufficiently guarantees the competitiveness and application prospect of an RBCC engine. This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic review of the research progress on the ejector mode of RBCC engines in different countries and different historical periods. In the survey, the summary delivers a progress overview on the ejector mode research, which covers a wealth of landmark experimental and application results on the ejector mode research in different historical periods. On this basis, a number of relevant key technologies regarding the study of the ejector mode are proposed, including efficient ejection, efficient mixing and combustion, widely adjustable rocket, widely applicable variable geometry inlet/nozzle design and control, multi-mode flow passage design, and robust mode transition. Several inherent scientific issues involved in these technologies are refined, such as the dynamic air ejection mechanism, combustion and thermal choke mechanism, and the coupling mechanism between air ejection and thermal choke. Finally, the historical development trend of ejector mode research is clarified, and some recommendations for performance improvement and the key technology breakthrough are provided for future ejector mode research of RBCC engines.},

  abstract = {Globally, emissions from aviation affect Earth's climate via complex processes. Contrail cirrus and carbon dioxide emissions are the largest factors contributing to aviation's radiative forcing on climate. Contrail cirrus, like natural cirrus clouds, impacts Earth's climate. Even with the extensive ongoing research, the relative importance of the climate effects of contrails compared to other aviation effects on climate still has major uncertainties requiring further research. Contrail cirrus encompasses linear contrails and the associated cirrus clouds; these are characterized by ice particle properties, e.g., size, concentration, mixing, extinction, ice water content, optical depth, geometrical depth, and cloud coverage. The climate impact of contrails may intensify due to projected increases in air traffic. The radiative forcing from global contrail cirrus has the potential to triple and could reach as much as 160 mW m−2 by 2050. This projection is based on anticipated growth in air traffic and a potential shift to higher altitudes. The future climate impact of contrail cirrus is influenced by factors like the magnitude and geographical spread in air traffic, advancements in fuel efficiency, the effects of the use of alternative fuels, and the effects of the changing climate on the background atmosphere. This study reviews the microphysical processes affecting contrail formation and the aging of contrails and contrail cirrus. Furthermore, the study explores global observational datasets for contrails, current analyses, and future projections and will aid in evaluating the effectiveness and tradeoffs associated with various mitigation strategies. The research highlights gaps in knowledge and uncertainties while outlining research priorities for the future.},

“Performance Increases for Gas-Turbine Engines Through Combustion Inside the Turbine” (Sirignano and Liu, 1999, p. 111) Paper shows a cycle analysis considering heat-addition in the turbine, briefly addressing potential modeling strategies and implementation challenges.. From the cycle analysis, it seems as though the application for this could be a vastly improved alternative/augmentation to a conventional afterburner, due to the increased pressure during combustion (in the turbine), and we see additionally this technique allows for increased thrust especially at high-mach numbers, where I speculate the stagnation temperature recovery limits heat addition to comply with material limits of the turbine (this can somewhat get around that by continuing to add heat after the turbine inlet).

  abstract = {Improving launch vehicle and satellite propulsion system performance directly correlates to the delivery of more mass (or quantity) on orbit from launch vehicles, longer duration satellite missions, and longer ranges for missiles/interceptors. Alternative propulsion devices such as rotating detonation engines (RDEs) offer the potential for significant performance gains but their operability has only been demonstrated on “battle hardened” laboratory devices for rocket applications. The objective of this research was to demonstrate cooling and structural approaches that mature rotating detonation rocket engines (RDREs) to flight like maturation levels.Multiple 1.6”/4.1 cm diameter RDE combustors were designed, fabricated, and tested. The RDE tested the most accumulated 309 seconds of hot fire testing and 118 starts/shutdowns. Long duration testing was completed to characterize heat flux and high cycle fatigue (HCF) loading. Large quantities of short duration tests were completed to evaluate thermal cycling impacts to the combustor structure and evaluate low cycle fatigue (LCF) loading. The hardware experienced 118 LCF loadings on the combustor cooling passages, equivalent to the amount of thermal cycle starts and shutdowns. An endurance test was completed at 60 seconds in duration, demonstrating operation well beyond thermal steady state. Additionally, \textasciitilde 3.7 million HCF loadings were placed on the combustor cooling passages, equivalent to the approximate amount of detonation wave passes present for all of the WC 2.0 testing.Predicted operating pressures ranged from 5 to 15 atm. The highest-pressure conditions resulted in hot gas wall temperatures exceeding 1000°F on the outerbody of the combustor and injector face temperatures peaking at 350°F. Water calorimetry was used to compute heat fluxes, which were then compared to traditional rocket engine throat level heat fluxes calculated using Bartz equations under average operating conditions. The outerbody heat fluxes reached up to 3.7 kW/cm², while injector face heat fluxes reached a maximum of 1.6 kW/cm². When compared to Bartz throat level values, the outer-body heat fluxes varied from 0.9 to 1.6 times the throat level values, and injector heat fluxes ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 times the throat level values.A combined thermal and pressure loading fatigue assessment was completed that took into consideration mean stresses and cumulative damage from the spectrum of loading events. Traditional rocket combustor life is typically limited by the thermal cycles that can be placed on the cooling channel hot wall. The fatigue analysis results highlight the reduction in available low cycle fatigue life as RDE's experience larger thermal loads when compared to traditional rocket combustors. Low cycle fatigue life will become especially challenging in higher chamber pressure combustors where thermal environments are more extreme, and the ability keep hot wall temperatures within acceptable levels is more challenging.The study also highlights that the passing detonation wave provides a high cycle fatigue (HCF) failure mechanism that is not present in traditional rocket combustors. This failure mechanism is the result of the pressure pulse provided by the passing detonation wave causing a variable load on the hot wall. This variable load is applied at frequencies commonly in the 10's of kHz, resulting in large quantities of loading cycles when operated at rocket like durations ({$>$}60 sec). This HCF failure mechanism is most impactful at larger chamber pressures where the detonation pressure ratio causes peak pressures to be elevated, resulting in larger cyclic stresses and strains in the hot wall. The results indicate that high chamber pressure combustors may experience HCF life exceedances within seconds of operation.},

  abstract = {A nominally plane turbulent jet is synthesized by the interactions of a train of counter-rotating vortex pairs that are formed at the edge of an orifice by the time-periodic motion of a flexible diaphragm in a sealed cavity. Even though the jet is formed without net mass injection, the hydrodynamic impulse of the ejected fluid and thus the momentum of the ensuing jet are nonzero. Successive vortex pairs are not subjected to pairing or other subharmonic interactions. Each vortex of the pair develops a spanwise instability and ultimately undergoes transition to turbulence, slows down, loses its coherence and becomes indistinguishable from the mean jet flow. The trajectories of vortex pairs at a given formation frequency scale with the length of the ejected fluid slug regardless of the magnitude of the formation impulse and, near the jet exit plane, their celerity decreases monotonically with streamwise distance while the local mean velocity of the ensuing jet increases. In the far field, the synthetic jet is similar to conventional 2D jets in that cross-stream distributions of the time-averaged velocity and the corresponding rms fluctuations appear to collapse when plotted in the usual similarity coordinates. However, compared to conventional 2D jets, the streamwise decrease of the mean centerline velocity of the synthetic jet is somewhat higher (∼x−0.58), and the streamwise increase of its width and volume flow rate is lower (∼x0.88\,and\,∼x0.33,\,respectively). This departure from conventional self-similarity is consistent with the streamwise decrease in the jet’s momentum flux as a result of an adverse streamwise pressure gradient near its orifice.},

The MFC is constructed using piezofibers embedded in an epoxy matrix and coated with Kapton skin. The construction process of the MFC affords it vast advantages over the traditionally used piezoceramic material. The MFC is extremely flexible, allowing it to be bonded to structures that have curved surface without fear of accidental breakage or additional surface treatment as is the case with monolithic piezoceramic materials. Additionally the MFC uses interdigitated electrodes that capitalize on the higher d33 piezoelectric coupling coefficient, allowing it to produce higher forces and strain than typical monolithic piezoceramic materials. The research presented in this thesis investigates some potential applications for the MFC as well as additional topics in power harvesting.},

Our method is based on computing and merging depth maps. Different from previous methods of this category, the silhouette information is also applied in our algorithm to recover the shape information on the textureless and occluded areas. The proposed algorithm starts by computing visual hull using a volumetric method in which a novel projection test method is proposed for visual hull octree construction. Then, the depth map of each image is estimated by an expansion-based approach that returns a 3D point cloud with outliers and redundant information. After generating an oriented point cloud from stereo by rejecting outlier, reducing scale, and estimating surface normal for the depth maps, another oriented point cloud from silhouette is added by carving the visual hull octree structure using the point cloud from stereo to restore the textureless and occluded surfaces. Finally, Poisson Surface Reconstruction approach is applied to convert the oriented point cloud both from stereo and silhouette into a complete and accurate triangulated mesh model. The proposed approach has been implemented and the performance of the approach is demonstrated on several real data sets, along with qualitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art image-based modeling techniques according to the Middlebury benchmark.},

Stable detonation was carried out without an oxygen supplement at a temperature of the incoming air of 419 K, and the technical advantage of using precombustion cracking to activate kerosene was verified. Cross-correlation analysis and high-speed image diagnosis were then used to analyze the mode of the detonation wave. The results show that the mode was a double-wave collision, and the speed of propagation of two opposing waves was different such that it led to the movement of the points of collision. The results of the cross-correlation analysis were used to determine the trajectory of these points. High-speed image-based mode recognition was used to directly observe the processes of conversion of the single-wave and double-wave modes of collision, where the velocity of the wave was 900~m/s as determined by the time–space diagram. The effect of the number of injection holes on the boundary of detonation was also examined. We found that the boundary of detonation shifted to lean with a decreasing number of injection holes.},

This meshless function evaluation tool is then coupled to an optimization scheme, based on evolutionary algorithms that minimize the entropy generation across the supersonic passage.

Thus, there is a critical need to establish fast models to calculate the time-dependent temperature and pressure at the combustor outlet for further engine analysis and turbine integration. This manuscript describes a fast 2D simulation code of a rotating detonation combustor. This numerical methodology uses a 1D chemical kinetics solver, to reproduce the change of properties across the detonation wave front. The post-detonation flow is then resolved using a method of characteristics, which allows the prediction of pressure and temperature gain across the combustor. The main flow pattern, including the detonation front features, the shock wave angle and the outlet properties were compared with the solution of a two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes solver. This approach is subsequently used to predict the detonation height based on the entropy generation across the combustor.},

  abstract = {A rotating detonation combustor is a form of ‘‘pressure gain combustion” where one or more detonations continuously travel around an annular channel. Pressure gain combustion is a prospective technology being explored to advance gas turbine power plants. These thermodynamic cycles could potentially deliver a performance increase of 20\% beyond the current state of the art. However, the combustor operates at extremely unsteady harsh conditions, and the integration of the combustor with the turbomachinery represent unprecedented aero-thermo-structural challenges. At a given instant each stream line experiences a different compression process through the combustor. In contrast to conventional combustors, where a steady approach is valid, in rotating detonation engines the flow particles entering the compressor will be exposed to different processes depending on the relative position of the rotor shaft to the detonation front. Hence, the overall performance assessment requires the development of ad-hoc tools suitable for this new class of combustors, and the modeling of the turbine exposed to supersonic pulsating flows. This paper presents a numerical tool to evaluate precisely the thermodynamic and nonisentropic processes across the entire engine. The NASA’s Toolbox for the Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems was used to implement new libraries to help us quantify the benefits of a rotating detonation engine versus the conventional technology equipped with constant pressure combustion. The new developed libraries, based on sets of physics-based principles, replicate the engine components performance. This model should allow the optimization of components with respect to energy availability to enable optimal engine sizing and operation. Finally, the paper presents the pressure ratios for which the rotating detonation based engine outperforms the conventional power plants based on the Brayton cycle.},

A reduced-order solver examines the supersonic blade rows’ functional design space, quantifies the turbine’s non-isentropic performance, and budgets the turbine loss for different optimized leading-edge designs and chord to pitch ratios. The shock-wave interactions were identified as the predominant contributor to turbine losses, and optimal pitch-chord ratios were determined for various inlet Mach numbers.

  abstract = {Conventional gas turbines are approaching their efficiency limits and performance gains are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Pressure Gain Combustion (PGC) has emerged as a very promising technology in this respect, due to the higher thermal efficiency of the respective ideal gas turbine thermodynamic cycles. Up to date, only very simplified models of open cycle gas turbines with pressure gain combustion have been considered. However, the integration of a fundamentally different combustion technology will be inherently connected with additional losses. Entropy generation in the combustion process, combustor inlet pressure loss (a central issue for pressure gain combustors), and the impact of PGC on the secondary air system (especially blade cooling) are all very important parameters that have been neglected. The current work uses the Humphrey cycle in an attempt to address all these issues in order to provide gas turbine component designers with benchmark efficiency values for individual components of gas turbines with PGC. The analysis concludes with some recommendations for the best strategy to integrate turbine expanders with PGC combustors. This is done from a purely thermodynamic point of view, again with the goal to deliver design benchmark values for a more realistic interpretation of the cycle.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) bipropellant rocket engines have been in use since the 1950’s in launch vehicles, sounding rockets, and as RATO (Rocket Assisted TakeOff) units for aircraft. Often, these engines function at a low chamber pressure using pressure-fed propellants, open-cycle turbo-pumps, or low-pressure closed-cycle turbo-pumps. As a result, hydrogen peroxide bipropellant rocket engines have generally had limited performance relative to other engine architectures. Modern advances in high-pressure catalyst bed design at Purdue’s Zucrow Research Laboratories as well as select use of transpiration cooling have made it possible to improve upon prior art by operating with a high-performance closedcycle pump arrangement at high chamber pressure (3200 psia). This leads to higher specific impulse, lower weight, and smaller engine components. The following report describes a design study for the injector, combustion chamber, and nozzle assembly associated with a small, 5,000 lbf thrust engine using this high-pressure cycle concept with 90\% hydrogen peroxide and RP-1 propellants. Engine cycle design, chamber sizing, cooling selection and analysis, performance analysis, and structural design and analysis are all discussed. While many elements of the engine design require additional development prior to manufacturing, this study shows that very high-pressure closed-cycle hydrogen peroxide bipropellant engines should be feasible. © 2014 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

  abstract = {Forest biomass harvesting guidelines help ensure the ecological sustainability of forest residue harvesting for bioenergy and bioproducts, and hence contribute to social license for a growing bioeconomy. Guidelines, typically voluntary, provide a means to achieve outcomes often required by legislation, and must address needs related to local or regional context, jurisdictional compatibility with regulations, issues of temporal and spatial scale, and incorporation of appropriate scientific information. Given this complexity, comprehensive reviews of existing guidelines can aid in development of new guidelines or revision of existing ones. We reviewed 32 guidelines covering 43 jurisdictions in the USA, Canada, Europe and East Asia to expand upon information evaluated and recommendations provided in previous guideline reviews, and compiled a searchable spreadsheet of direct quotations from documents as a foundation for our review. Guidelines were considered in the context of sustainable forest management (SFM), focusing on guideline scope and objectives, environmental sustainability concerns (soils, site productivity, biodiversity, water and carbon) and social concerns (visual aesthetics, recreation, and preservation of cultural, historical and archaeological sites). We discuss the role of guidelines within the context of other governance mechanisms such as SFM policies, trade regulations and non-state market-driven (NSMD) standards, including certification systems. The review provides a comprehensive resource for those developing guidelines, or defining sustainability standards for market access or compliance with public regulations, and/or concerned about the sustainability of forest biomass harvesting. We recommend that those developing or updating guidelines consider (i) the importance of well-defined and understood terminology, consistent where possible with guidelines in other jurisdictions or regions; (ii) guidance based on locally relevant research, and periodically updated to incorporate current knowledge and operational experience; (iii) use of indicators of sensitive soils, sites, and stands which are relevant to ecological processes and can be applied operationally; and (iv) incorporation of climate impacts, long-term soil carbon storage, and general carbon balance considerations when defining sustainable forest biomass availability. Successful implementation of guidelines depends both on the relevance of the information and on the process used to develop and communicate it; hence, appropriate stakeholders should be involved early in guideline development.},

  abstract = {The primary objective of the GTX effort is to determine whether or not air-breathing propulsion can enable a launch vehicle to achieve orbit in a single stage. Structural weight, vehicle aerodynamics, and propulsion performance must be accurately known over the entire flight trajectory in order to make a credible assessment. Structural, aerodynamic, and propulsion parameters are strongly interdependent, which necessitates a system approach to design, evaluation, and optimization of a single-stage-to-orbit concept. The GTX reference vehicle serves this purpose, by allowing design, development, and validation of components and subsystems in a system context. The reference vehicle configuration (including propulsion) was carefully chosen so as to provide high potential for structural and volumetric efficiency, and to allow the high specific impulse of air-breathing propulsion cycles to be exploited. Minor evolution of the configuration has occurred as analytical and experimental results have become available. With this development process comes increasing validation of the weight and performance levels used in system performance determination. This paper presents an overview of the GTX reference vehicle and the approach to its performance validation. Subscale test rigs and numerical studies used to develop and validate component performance levels and unit structural weights are outlined. The sensitivity of the equivalent, effective specific impulse to key propulsion component efficiencies is presented. The role of flight demonstration in development and validation is discussed.},

A discussion of the properties and applications of piezoelectric crystals and additional piezoelectric ceramics is followed by a description of several sensor configurations prepared from bulk ceramics. An extensive review and comparison of piezoelectric ceramic—polymer composite sensors based on the connectivity of the constituent phases is also presented. We conclude our discussion of sensor configurations with recent examples of piezoelectric ceramic—metal composite sensors, and expected future developments in the area of piezoelectric sensors.},

  abstract = {A turbopump is a propellant pump with two main components: a rotodynamic pump and a driving gas turbine, usually both mounted on the same shaft, or sometimes geared together. They were initially developed in Germany in the early 1940s. The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use. While other use cases exist, they are most commonly found in liquid rocket engines. There are two common types of pumps used in turbopumps: a centrifugal pump, where the pumping is done by throwing fluid outward at high speed, or an axial-flow pump, where alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid. Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give relatively modest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial flow pumps work well with low-density fluids. Centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high-density fluids but require large diameters for low-density fluids.},

  abstract = {Dead woody materials are naturally part of the forest ecosystem introduced through the process of tree mortality or intentionally through stand management practices which result in harvesting residues. The management of harvesting residues includes a range of solutions that vary from site to site, from context to context. The purpose of this review is to determine the current state-of-the-art of harvesting residue management treatments at a global scale. Our review indicates that there are few studies that compare residue management and treatment options, considering the variety of impacts and effects that can be generated. This is surprising as residue management affects residue quantity and distribution and is relevant for numerous ecological processes. The retention of fine and coarse residues can generate positive effects and impacts on various aspects of forest ecosystems including (i) biodiversity, by promoting stand regeneration and providing habitats for fauna at different levels; (ii) soil properties, by decreasing the risk of erosion and soil compaction while retaining moisture at ground level; and (iii) soil nutrients, by replenishing C, N, and micronutrient stocks. On the contrary, harvesting residues can provide material for bioenergy production and potentially other fiber industries. The removal of residues can also reduce wildfire risks and dampen insect outbreak dynamics. In this work, we provide a general outline of the role of residues as well as a summary of current management options adopted around the world. The intention of the work is to provide an information base for stakeholders including forest managers and policymakers in identifying and assessing potential alternatives for their current local practices.},

One of the throttling limitations of a pump-fed rocket engine is the stable operating range of the pump. Several varieties of pump hydraulic instabilities are mentioned. Some pump design criteria are summarized and a qualitative correlation of key parameters to pump stall and surge are referenced. Some of the design criteria were taken from the literature on high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors. Therefore, these have yet to be validated for extending the stable operating flow range of high-head pumps. Casing treatment devices, dynamic fluid-damping plenums, backflow-stabilizing vanes and flow-reinjection techniques are summarized. A planned program was undertaken at LeRC to validate these concepts. Technologies developed by this program will be available for the design of turbopumps for advanced space rocket engines for use by NASA in future space missions where throttling is essential.},

In conventional supersonic turbines operating under such extreme flow conditions, the presence of blades induces important flow perturbations that result in severe aerodynamic losses and restrictions in the operating range, seriously affected by starting issues. These limitations present design opportunities for a bladeless turbine configuration. The present paper documents, for the first time in literature, an axial bladeless turbine concept, which is able to extract mechanical power from high supersonic flows through an annular channel. The tangential drag force exerted on the rotating inner and outer end-walls produces power, together with enhanced simplicity, coolability, and maintainability. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations allowed the detailed evaluation of the aerodynamic performance of the bladeless configuration. This unconventional axial turbine concept becomes a design choice for extracting power from supersonic flows, with minimum pressure losses.},

  abstract = {Combined heat and power (CHP) concepts for small scale distributed power generation offer significant potential for saving energy and reducing CO2 emissions. Microturbines are an interesting candidate for small CHP systems with advantages in terms of performance, size, noise and costs.MTT has developed a 3kW recuperated microturbine for micro CHP applications, using turbocharger technology for the turbomachinery. In 2010, the development towards a 12.2\% efficient demonstrator has been described in [1]. The underlying paper describes the subsequent performance optimization work done to obtain the 18\% turbogenerator electric efficiency target.The work included research focused on improving several components and auxiliary systems resulting in many small loss reduction steps. Combustor performance was improved and emissions reduced. Large steps were made by improving compressor and turbine performance. Compressor efficiency and pressure ratio were optimized to obtain maximum cycle efficiency. Turbine efficiency was improved by a redesign of the turbine scroll.A detailed CFD study was performed to predict compressor design adaption effects on performance. A 60° sector model was used including inlet duct, impeller (including tip clearance) and diffusor. With prescribed inlet total pressure and total temperature and by varying the outlet static pressure boundary condition, the stationary flow field has been calculated for several operating points. The calculations have been carried out for both the original design and the adapted design.Results showed that pressure ratio could be increased from 2.9 up to 3.2 using simple adaptations (from the turbocharger original design) while maintaining isentropic efficiency.Finally, results of the test program and test analysis work are presented.},

Flutter denotes a self-excited and self-sustained aeroelastic instability phenomenon that can lead to material fatigue and eventually damage of structure in a short period of time unless properly damped. The design for flutter safety involves the prediction of unsteady aerodynamics as well as structural dynamics that is mostly based on inhouse developed numerical tools. While high confidence has been gained on the structural side unanticipated flutter occurrences during engine design, testing and operation evidence a need for enhanced validation of aerodynamic models despite the degree of sophistication attained. The continuous development of these models can only be based on the deepened understanding of underlying physical mechanisms from test data.},

An annular sector cascade has been employed in which the middle blade has been made oscillating in controlled three-dimensional rigid-body modes. Unsteady blade surface pressure data were acquired at midspan on the oscillating blade and two pairs of nonoscillating neighbor blades and reduced to aeroelastic stability data. The test program covered variations in reduced frequency, flow velocity, and inflow incidence; at each operating point, a set of three orthogonal modes was tested such as to allow for generation of stability plots by mode recombination. At nominal incidence, it has been found that increasing reduced frequency has a stabilizing effect on all modes. The analysis of mode shape sensitivity yielded that the most stable modes are of bending type with axial to chordwise character, whereas high sensitivity has been found for torsion-dominated modes. Negative incidence operation caused the flow to separate on the fore pressure side. This separation was found to have a destabilizing effect on bending modes of chordwise character, whereas an increase in stability could be noted for bending modes of edgewise character. Variations of stability parameter with inflow incidence have hereby found being largely linear within the range of conditions tested. For torsion-dominated modes, the influence on aeroelastic stability was close to neutral.},

  abstract = {Results are presented for separation bubbles of the type that can form near the leading edges of thin compressor or turbine blades. These often occur when the incidence is such that the stagnation point is not on the nose of the aerofoil. Tests were carried out at low speed on a single aerofoil to simulate the range of conditions found on compressor blades. Both circular and elliptic shapes of leading edge were tested. Results are presented for a range of incidence, Reynolds number, and turbulence intensity and scale. The principal quantitative measurements presented are the pressure distributions in the leading edge and bubble region, as well as the boundary layer properties at a fixed distance downstream, where most of the flows had reattached. Reynolds number was found to have a comparatively small influence, but a raised level of free-stream turbulence has a striking effect, shortening or eliminating the bubble and increasing the magnitude of the suction spike. Increased free-stream turbulence also reduces the boundary layer thickness and shape parameter after the bubble. Some explanations of the processes are outlined.},

  abstract = {Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) provide a promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from combustion-based propulsion and power systems by improving their thermodynamic efficiency through the application of pressure-gain combustion. However, the thermodynamic and systems-level advantages remain unrealized due to the challenge of harnessing the tightly coupled physics and nonlinear detonation dynamics inherent to RDEs, particularly for the less-detonable reactants characteristic of applications. Therefore, a RDE was developed to operate with natural gas and air as the primary reactants at elevated chamber pressures and air preheat temperatures, providing a platform to study RDEs with the less-detonable reactants and flow conditions representative of land-based power generation gas turbine engines. The RDE was tested with two injector configurations in a broad, parametric survey of flow conditions to determine the effect of operating parameters on the propagation of detonation waves in the combustor and delivered performance. Measurements of chamber wave dynamics were performed using high-frequency pressure transducers and high-speed imaging of broadband combustion chemiluminescence, while thrust measurements were used to characterize the work output potential.The detonation dynamics were first studied to characterize RDE operability for the target application. Wave propagation speeds of up to 70\% of the mixture Chapman-Jouguet detonation velocity and chamber pressure fluctuations greater than 4 times the mean chamber pressure were observed. Supplementing the air with additional oxygen, varying the equivalence ratio, and enriching the fuel with hydrogen revealed that combustor operability is sensitive to the chemical kinetics of the reactant mixture. While most test conditions exhibited counter-rotating detonation waves within the chamber, one injector design was able to support single wave propagation. A thermodynamic performance model was developed to aid analysis of RDE performance by making comparisons of net pressure gain for identical flow conditions. While the injector that supported a single wave operating mode better followed the trends predicted by the model, neither injector achieved the desire stagnation pressure gain relative to the reactant manifold pressure. Application of the model to a generic RDE revealed the necessity of normalizing any RDE performance parameter by the driving system potential and identified the area ratio between the exhaust and injection throats as the primary parameter affecting delivered pressure gain. A pair of test conditions with distinct wave dynamics were selected from the parametric survey to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the exhaust flow using high-speed particle image velocimetry. A single detonation wave with an intermittent counter-rotating wave was characterized in the first test case, while a steady counter-rotating mode was studied in the second. The velocity measurements were phase averaged with respect to the instantaneous wave location to reveal contrasting flowfields for the two cases. The total pressure and temperature of flow exiting the combustor were computed using the phase-resolved velocity measurements along with the measured reactant flowrate and thrust to close the global balance of mass and momentum, providing an improved method of quantifying RDE performance. Finally, a reduced order model for studying RDE operability and mode selection was developed. The circumferential detonation wave dynamics are simulated and permitted to naturally evolve into the quasi-steady state operating modes observed in RDEs. Preliminary verification studies are presented and areas for further development are identified to enable the model to reach a broader level of applicability.The experimental component of this work has advanced understanding of RDE operation with less-detonable reactants and developed improved methods for quantifying RDE performance. The accompanying modeling has elucidated the design parameters and flow conditions that influence RDE performance and provided a framework to investigate the factors that govern RDE mode selection and operability.},

The results show that the low octane gasoline-like fuel PRF70 exhibits better performance than conventional high octane gasoline PRF92 at the current operating condition. Details of the combustion process of PRF70 and PRF92 are analyzed and compared. It’s revealed that the poor combustion performance of PRF92 mainly results from overmixing, while it can be significantly improved with PRF70 due to its higher reactivity than PRF92. The performances of PRF70 and PRF92 are also compared over a wide range of EGR and SOI timing conditions. It’s found that, within the scope of this study, PRF70 can not only obtain higher thermal efficiency while maintaining lower MPRR, but also significantly reduce both HC and CO emissions with similar soot and NOx emissions compared to PRF92, indicating the potential of PRF70 for high load extension. In addition, energy distribution analysis shows from a macroscopic perspective that compared to PRF92, the improved thermal efficiency of PRF70 mainly results from lower exhaust and combustion losses.},

Third, we give an optimal projection fringe modulation/background intensity ratio. Fourth, we propose a method for estimating the reflectivity of the object surface and ambient light interference, and a method for adjusting the projection intensity at the pixel level and a method for estimating the optimal exposure time. Experiments show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method not only can obtain high-quality captured images, but also has higher measurement efficiency and wider application range.},

“The Wave Combustor is an airbreathing hypersonic propulsion system which utilizes shock and detonation waves to enhance fuel-air mixing and combustion in supersonic flow. In this concept, an oblique shock wave in the combustor can act as a flameholder by increasing the pressure and temperature of the air-fuel mixture and thereby decreasing the ignition delay. If the oblique shock is sufficiently strong, then the combustion front and the shock wave can couple into a detonation wave. In this case, combustion occurs almost instantateously in a thin zone behind the wave front. The result is a shorter, lighter engine compared to the scramjet. This engine, which is called the Oblique Detonation Wave Engine (ODWE), can then be utilized to provide a smaller, lighter vehicle or to provide a higher payload capability for a given vehicle weight. An analysis of the performance of a conceptual trans-atmospheric vehicle (TAV) powered by an ODWE is given here.” (“Wave combustors for trans-atmospheric vehicles”, p. 5) Great explanation of ODWE},

  abstract = {The study presents a new type of detonation engine called the Ram-Rotor Detonation Engine (RRDE), which overcomes some of the drawbacks of conventional detonation engines such as pulsed detonation engines, oblique detonation engines, and rotating detonation engines. The RRDE organizes the processes of reactant compression, detonation combustion, and burned gas expansion in a single rotor, allowing it to achieve an ideal detonation cycle under a wide range of inlet Mach numbers, thus significantly improving the total pressure gain of the propulsion system. The feasibility and performance of RRDE are discussed through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The theoretical analysis indicates that the performance of the RRDE is mainly related to the inlet velocity, the rotor rim velocity, and the equivalence ratio of reactant. Increasing the inlet velocity leads to a decrease in the total pressure gain of the RRDE. Once the inlet velocity exceeds the critical value, the engine cannot achieve positive total pressure gain. Increasing the rim velocity can improve the total pressure gain and the thermodynamic cycle efficiency of RRDE. Increasing the equivalence ratio can also improve the thermodynamic cycle efficiency and enhance the total pressure gain at lower inlet velocities. While at higher inlet velocities, increasing the equivalence ratio may reduce the total pressure gain. Numerical simulations are also performed to analyze the detailed flow field structure in RRDE and its variations with the inlet parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that the detonation wave can stably stand in the RRDE and can adapt to the change of the inlet equivalence ratio within a certain range. This study provides the preliminary theoretical basis and design reference for the RRDE.},

  abstract = {Contrails (; short for "condensation trails") or vapor trails are line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure, typically at aircraft cruising altitudes several kilometres/miles above the Earth's surface. They are composed primarily of water, in the form of ice crystals. The combination of water vapor in aircraft engine exhaust and the low ambient temperatures at high altitudes causes the trails' formation. Impurities in the engine exhaust from the fuel, including soot and sulfur compounds (0.05\% by weight in jet fuel) provide some of the particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei  for water droplet growth in the exhaust. If water droplets form, they can freeze to form ice particles that compose a contrail. Their formation can also be triggered by changes in air pressure in wingtip vortices, or in the air over the entire wing surface. Contrails, and other clouds caused directly by human activity, are called homogenitus. Depending on the temperature and humidity at the altitude where the contrails form, they may be visible for only a few seconds or minutes, or persist long enough to form near continuous layers of cirrus cloud. Persistent contrails are of particular interest to scientists. The resulting cloud forms are formally described as homomutatus, and may resemble cirrus, cirrocumulus, or cirrostratus, and are sometimes called cirrus aviaticus. Some persistent spreading contrails contribute to climate change.},

Efficient alternative methods with truncations in time and/or in space have been developed for unsteady turbomachinery flows in the past 20 years or so, but they all are associated with related limitations. The present development is motivated to maintain as many modelling fidelities of direct unsteady solution methods as possible while still have a significant speed-up. To this end, a new steady-solution-like unsteady time-domain methodology has been developed for bladerow interactions. No circumferential domain truncation is required so that a direct periodic (repeating) condition can be applied. For each mesh cell, the temporal gradient term as required to balance the discretized unsteady flow equation is obtained by specially sequenced spatial variations of corresponding cells in multiple-passages. Consequently the rotor-stator interface treatment becomes completely compatible to that of a direct unsteady solution. Thus a fully conservative interface is easily achieved, in contrast to existing truncated models where interface treatments tend to be complicated and non-conservative. The simultaneous solution procedure with the space-time gradient (STG) link enables an unsteady flow solution to converge at a rate comparable to that of a steady solution. The background, motivation/justification, basic methodology and some preliminary verifications are described in this paper as Part I. Further validations and applications with extension to more complex configurations and flow conditions will be presented in Part II.

However, it is very challenging due to material and printing technology limitations. Here, we present a resin design strategy that can be used for single-vat single-cure grayscale digital light processing (g-DLP) 3D printing where light intensity can locally control the conversion of monomers to form from a highly stretchable soft organogel to a stiff thermoset within in a single layer of printing. The high modulus contrast and high stretchability can be realized simultaneously in a monolithic structure at a high printing speed (z-direction height 1\,mm/min). We further demonstrate that the capability can enable previously unachievable or hard-to-achieve 3D printed structures for biomimetic designs, inflatable soft robots and actuators, and soft stretchable electronics. This resin design strategy thus provides a material solution in multimaterial additive manufacture for a variety of emerging applications.},

  abstract = {Wingtip vortices have been proven to be detrimental to both aircraft efficiency and safety due to their adverse effects such as wake hazard, blade vortex interaction noise and induced drag. Despite the extensive literature on the subject, the number of experimental works featuring far field velocity measurements under active control is very limited. The present work deals with the experimental investigation of the effectiveness of synthetic jet actuation on the control of wingtip vortices and their wake hazard. In order to preserve the mutual induction of the counter-rotating vortices during their evolution, an unswept, low aspect ratio, squared-tipped, finite-span wing is employed. The synthetic jet actuation is based on triggering the inherent instabilities of Crow and Widnall at different values of the momentum coefficient Cμ with the goal of reducing the vortex strength and obtaining an anticipated vortex break up. Different exit geometries of the synthetic jets have been tested to analyze the effects of the jet velocity and position on the wingtip vortices. Phase-locked measurements of the velocity field in the far wake at a distance from the wing trailing edge from 26 to 80 chord lengths have been performed via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The effects of blowing at high momentum coefficient Cμ=1\% are demonstrated to be remarkable on the mitigation of the wingtip vortices. On the other hand, both the time and phase-averaged results suggest that, at relatively low values of Cμ (0.2\%), using a larger synthetic jet exit section area allows to greatly affect the wingtip vortices' features causing a striking alleviation of the vorticity distribution up to 90\% with respect to the baseline reference case. In fact, due to the actuation at low frequency, the vortex instability is prematurely risen up and amplified, leading to early vortices linking and their consequent dissipation.},

“Ultra-short combustors to minimize residence time, with special flame-holding mechanisms to cope with increased through-velocities are likely in the future. The Ultra-Compact Combustor (UCC), a novel design based on trapped-vortex combustor (TVC) work that uses high swirl in a circumferential cavity to enhance reaction rates via high cavity g-loading on the order of 3000 g's. Increase in reaction rates translates to a reduced combustor volume. Three combustor geometric features were varied during experiments (1) high-g cavity flame-holding method, (2) high-g cavity to main airflow transport method, and (3) fuel injection method. Results have shown promise for advanced engine applications. Lean blowout fuel-air ratio limits at 25-50\% the value of current systems were demonstrated. Combustion efficiency was measured over a wide range of UCC operating conditions.

  abstract = {Trapped vortex combustor (TVC) is different from conventional swirl-stabilized combustors. It takes advantages of a cavity to stabilize the flame. When the cavity size of a TVC is well designed, a large rotating vortex can be formed in the cavity. The vortex cannot shed out the cavity and is thus named a “locked” or “stable” vortex. One of the main challenges for TVC design is fuel injection. Typically, fuel can be injected directly into the cavity or from the diffuser upstream. Injecting from the diffuser leads to the fuel being mixed with the air before it enters the combustor. When the fuel is injected directly into the cavity, it is desirable to supply the fuel in such way that the locked vortex in the cavity is reinforced. Furthermore, the fuel-air mixing in the cavity will be promoted, as the bypass air is directly added into the cavity. Since the recirculation zone anchored in the cavity is not exposed to the main incoming flow, stable combustion is achieved, even in the presence of a high speed main flow as typically expected in Ramjets and Scramjets. A well-designed trapped vortex combustor (TVC) enables a better fuel-air mixing, a better stabilized flame, lower emission, ultra-compact and high efficient combustion to be achievable. As a promising combustion concept, intensive scientific research has been conducted on TVC in the application areas of aerospace propulsion, power generation and waste incineration. In this work, we will firstly introduce the fundamental concepts, the development and evolution history of TVCs. The combustion, aerodynamics, and aeroacoustics features of trapped vortex combustion are then described. This includes reviewing and discussing the cavity flow/aerodynamics, fuel-air injection and mixing, trapped vortex combustion, emission and combustion of alternative fuels, and aeroacoustics characteristics. The ‘spin-off’ application of trapped vortex combustion concept for the design of ultra-compact and high-g combustors, inter-turbine burners, in-Situ and flameless TVC reheat combustors are then reviewed and discussed. Various practical applications of trapped vortex combustion concept in gas turbines, ramjets, scramjets and waste incinerators are discussed and summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions of the design and implementation of TVCs are provided.},

In this study, experiments have been performed on a structure combining a rotating detonation combustor and an axial-flow turbine to investigate the propagation characteristics of the hydrogen-air rotating detonation wave. The stable rotating detonation wave is successfully initiated using the spark plug and pre-detonator, and there is still a velocity deficit of about 20\% relative to the Chapmane-Jouguet value. There is a formation process for the stable detonation wave, and the formation time for the pre-detonator is far less than the spark plug, however the final state is independent on the ignition device. The rotating detonation wave successively appears the two-wave state with a same direction, the two-peak wave state, and the state of strong–weak alternation during the formation process. Finally, only one stable detonation wave is formed in the chamber and propagates until the operation off.},
