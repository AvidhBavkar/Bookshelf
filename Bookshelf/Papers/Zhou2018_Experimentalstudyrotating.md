[[Pressure Gain Combustion]]
# Abstract
The research on rotating detonation turbine engine is attracting much attention in recent years. In this study, experiments have been performed on a structure combining a [[Rotating Detonation]] combustor and an axial-flow turbine to investigate the propagation characteristics of the hydrogen-air rotating detonation wave. The stable rotating detonation wave is successfully initiated using the spark plug and pre-detonator, and there is still a velocity deficit of about 20% relative to the Chapmane-Jouguet value. There is a formation process for the stable detonation wave, and the formation time for the pre-detonator is far less than the spark plug, however the final state is independent on the ignition device. The rotating detonation wave successively appears the two-wave state with a same direction, the two-peak wave state, and the state of strong–weak alternation during the formation process. Finally, only one stable detonation wave is formed in the chamber and propagates until the operation off.

* Combustor details:
	* [[Hydrogen-Air]] [[slot-orifice injector]] configuration:
		* 120 0.8mm H2 orifices
		* 1.5mm annular slot for air
		* Fuel pressure 2.8 Bar

	- Predetonator:
		- [[H2-Gox]] [[predetonator]]
			- Lit w/ an auto spark plug, 
			- 2g/s total mass flow rate, 
			- equivalence ratio = 1
