# Abstract
A multitube [[Pulse Detonation Combustor]] consisting of eight unvalved tubes arranged in a can-annular configuration was integrated with a single-stage [[Axial Turbine]] nominally rated for 10 lbm=s, 25,000 rpm and 1000 hp. The multitube [[Pulse Detonation Combustor - Turbine]] hybrid was operated using [[Ethylene-Air]] mixtures for runs of 5 min to achieve thermal steady state in order to quantify performance at two operating conditions using simultaneous and sequential firing patterns. Analysis of these data reveal that turbine efficiency under pulse detonation-combustor-fired operation was indistinguishable from steady performance within the 8 points measurement uncertainty. Furthermore, the pulse-detonation-combustor-turbine hybrid system demonstrated a potential 25% improvement in efficiency once corrections were made for the suboptimal fueling design, which resulted in lower-than-anticipated combustion efficiency. The present work is promising as it suggests that a pulse detonation-combustor-turbine hybrid engine performance benefit can be realized with further development.

# Goal/Question
Quantifying the turbine performance and overall efficiency of a [[Pulse Detonation Combustor - Turbine]] gas-turbine like system.

# Methodology
- Hardware:
	- ![[Pasted image 20251014194438.png]]
	- [[Multitube PDC]]
		- 8 **unvalved** tubes
			- Air is continuously flowing
				- Unchoked relative to the primary plenum.
			- Fuel is pulsed injection via high-speed valves
		- [[Can-Annular]] Configuration
			* [[Coaxial Cooling Liner]] used to cool w/ "secondary air":
				- Eventually dumped to merge w/ main stream as dilution air 
	- 
		- 30 Hz (per tube)
		- Water-Cooled [[Spiral DDT geometry]] used to help assist detonation
	- Single-Stage [[Axial Turbine]]
		- Nominally rated for 10lbm, 25,000 RPM, **1000 hp**
		- From a "locomotive turbocharger"
		- Compressor served as air-brake [[Compressor Air-Brake Dyno]].
