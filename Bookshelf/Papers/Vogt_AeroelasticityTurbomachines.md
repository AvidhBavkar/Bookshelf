# Abstract

**Slide Show** for MUSAF II Colloquium in 2013.
# Notes
- Why? Motivation?
	- Accurate & Reliable flutter prediction = greener engines
	- ^ less parts, more aggressive loadings = more aeroelastic concerns!

### Aeroelasticity Crash Course:
[[Flutter]] is a **self-excited phenomena**
![[Pasted image 20251020201146.png]]
Associated with **negative overall damping**:
- vibration starts by itself if the fluid-structure coupled system goes unstable
- rapidly diverges.
- In reality, it usually hits a "limit cycle oscillation" or LCO
- ![[Pasted image 20251020201526.png]]
- Can be tolerated

Interaction between **structures** and **aerodynamics**:

But what about F(t)?
- Due to **flow** and **motion** of the blade
- Arbitrary direction, but only the component **in direction of the mode** that matters
- Most probably **not perfectly in phase with the motion**

The part of the **aerodynamic force that's out-of-phase** with the motion (thus leading to a "positive damping") is referred to as [[Aerodamping]]

**Aerodynamic Influence**: you don't usually just have one blade, you have a dozens.. A single oscillating blade will influence all the other blades via the unsteady flow field, here's an example with one blade moving:

**Traveling wave mode stability** and the [[Influence Coefficient Approach]]: linear superposition of unsteady pressure:

### How well are we presently doing in predicting flutter?
[[FUTURE Program]] (Flutter-free turbomachinery blades)
![[Pasted image 20251020204543.png]]
Currently, not so good - the variance is equal in magnitude to the predicted damping...

Planned experimental test cases:
1- [[Transonic Compressor Aeroelasticity]]
2- [[Low-Pressure Turbine Aeroelasticity]]

Experimental facilities:
Non rotating cascades
Rotating rigs:
- Multi-blade row
- Free & Forced oscillation

Numerical analyses performed by partners.

Measurement techniques:
- Steady Aero
- [[Blade Tip Timing]]
- [[Piezo-resistive pressure sensor]]

Actuation [[Blade Excitation]]:
- [[Controlled Aerodynamic Excitation]] with jets:

# The Op-Ed
- Great "crash course" in turbomachinery aeroelasticity, and the work with the transonic cascades and excitation systems will be very interesting!
