Factor first described to me in [[Rankin2017_OverviewPerformanceApplication]] as the ratio of turbine power generated : chemical power put in.

In their rig, the factor was defined like this:

(It was a turboshaft so the numerator is the HPT power (compressor) + LPT power (turbine))

**I guess that this metric should be used very carefully when considering thrust-generating machines (like turbofan/jets) or anything where energy downstream of the turbine is desirable**
