**Definition: The annular gap size of a [[Rotating Detonation]] combustor

From [[Rankin2017_OverviewPerformanceApplication]], here is the effect of the channel width on ISP as a function of equivalence ratio for an H2-Air RDE:

According to the authors:
- Caused by 3D effects:
	- Propellant mixing
	- Flow recirculation losses at base of channel **Important: They used kind of like a "backward facing step" for this experiment, not sure if these losses go-away significantly with a nicer nozzle**
	- Changes in radial length scales across the channel (??)
