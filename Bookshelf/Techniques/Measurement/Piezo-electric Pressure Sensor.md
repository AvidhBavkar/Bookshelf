Found this initially from [[Rasheed2011_ExperimentalInvestigationsPerformance]]:
- From initial research, its a **high frequency** **dynamic only** pressure sensor.

A kulite ([[Piezo-resistive pressure sensor]]) is basically a little strain gauge - gets the dynamic and absolute pressure signals - but its limited in to (relatively) lower frequencies and temperatures, wheras the piezo-electric crystal can withstand harsher conditions and higher frequencies, but only gives a dynamic signal.
